sumitomo bank aims at quick recovery from merger sumitomo bank ltd lt sumi is certain to lose its status as japan most profitable bank as result of its merger with the heiwa sogo bank financial analysts said
osaka based sumitomo with desposits of around trillion yen merged with heiwa sogo small struggling bank with an estimated billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans in october
but despite the link up sumitomo president koh komatsu told reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain its position
we ll be back in position in first place within three years komatsu said in an interview
he said that while the merger will initially reduce sumitomo profitability and efficiency it will vastly expand sumitomo branch network in the tokyo metropolitan area where it has been relatively weak
but financial analysts are divided on whether and how quickly the gamble will pay off
some said sumitomo may have paid too much for heiwa sogo in view of the smaller bank large debts
others argue the merger was more cost effective than creating comparable branch network from scratch
the analysts agreed the bank was aggressive
it has expanded overseas entered the lucrative securities business and geared up for domestic competition but they questioned the wisdom of some of those moves
they ve made bold moves to put everything in place
now it largely out of their hands said kleinwort benson ltd financial analyst simon smithson
among sumitomo problems are limits placed on its move to enter securities business by taking share in american investment bank goldman sachs and co sumitomo last august agreed to pay mln dlrs for pct limited partnership in the bank but for the time being at least the federal reserve board has forbidden them to exchange personnel or increase the business they do with each other
the tie up is widely looked on as lame duck because the fed was stricter than sumitomo expected said one analyst
but komatsu said the move will pay off in time
regulations will change in the near future and if so we can do various things
we only have to wait two or three years not until the century komatsu said
komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes into the securities business at home
article of the securities and exchange act japan version of the glass steagall act separates commercial from investment banking
but the walls between the two are crumbling and komatsu said he hopes further deregulation will create new opportunities
we need to find new business chances komatsu said
in some cases these will be securities related in some cases trust bank related
that the kind of deregulation we want
until such changes occur sumitomo will focus on such domestic securities business as profitable government bond dealing and strengthening relations with meiko securities co ltd in which it holds five pct share komatsu said
he said sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering the securities business here through its swiss universal bank subsidiary banca del gottardo
the finance ministry is expected to grant licences to securities subsidiaries of commercial banks soon following similar decision for subsidiaries of european universal banks in which the parent holds less than pct
but komatsu is reluctant to push hard for similar decision on gottardo subsidiary
we don want to make waves
we expect this will be allowed in two or three years he said
like other city banks sumitomo is also pushing to expand lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to replace disappearing demand from big business he added
the analysts said sumitomo will have to devote lot of time to digesting its most recent initiatives including the merger with ailing heiwa sogo
it sumitomo been bold in its strategies said kleinwort smithson
after that it question of absorbing and juggling around
it will be the next decade before we see if the strategy is right or wrong

bundesbank allocates billion marks in tender the bundesbank accepted bids for billion marks at today tender for day securities repurchase pact at fixed rate of pct central bank spokesman said
banks which bid for total billion marks liquidity will be credited with the funds allocated today and must buy back securities pledged on may
some billion marks will drain from the market today as an earlier pact expires so the bundesbank is effectively withdrawing net billion marks from the market with today allocation
bundesbank spokesman said in answer to enquiries that the withdrawal of funds did not reflect tightening of credit policy but was to be seen in the context of plentiful liquidity in the banking system
banks held an average billion marks at the bundesbank over the first six days of the month well clear of the likely april minimum reserve requirement of billion marks
the bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only billion marks below the outgoing billion banks themselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity
dealers said the bundesbank is keen to prevent too much liquidity accruing in the market as that would blunt the effectiveness of the security repurchase agreement its main open market instrument for steering market interest rates
two further pacts are likely this month over the next two weeks
the bundesbank is currently steering call money between and pct although short term fluctuations outside that range are possible dealers said

japan ministry says open farm trade would hit japan agriculture ministry angered by
demands that japan open its farm products market will tell officials at talks later this month that liberalisation would harm existing farm exports to japan senior ministry official said
imports from the would drop due to active sales drives by other suppliers the official who declined to be named said
japan is the largest customer for farm products and it is not reasonable for the to demand japan liberalise its farm import market he said
agriculture minister mutsuki kato has said if the
insists japan open its protected rice market it will also open its wheat market where volume and origin are regulated to protect local farmers
australia and canada could then increase their wheat exports as they are more competitive than the he said
end users would also buy other origins grain traders said
agriculture secretary richard lyng who is due to visit japan for talks between april has said he will ask japan to offer share of its rice market to
suppliers and remove quotas on
beef and citrus imports
other countries are already cutting into the market share here
australia the largest beef supplier to japan has been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of four year beef accord next march
imports of corn have fallen due to increased sales from china and south america while japanese soybean imports from brazil are expected to rise sharply this year although the will remain the largest supplier
feedgrain sales will also drop if japan opens up its beef imports since japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain imports mainly from the japanese officials said
an indication of the
position came last december when under secretary of agriculture daniel amstutz said japan has the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to
agricultural exports with the beef market alone representing some one billion dlrs in new business
the has also asked the general agreement on tariffs and trade to investigate the legality of japanese import controls on other farm products including fruit juices purees and pulp tomato juice ketchup and sauce peanuts prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans
to help calm heated trade relations with the japan top business group keidanren has urged the government to remove residual import restrictions on agricultural products
but agriculture minister kato has ruled out any emotional reaction and the senior ministry official said the farm issue should not become scapegoat for trade pressure in the industrial sector
japan is the largest buyer of farm products and these issues should not be discussed on the same table the official said

south korea moves to slow growth of trade surplus south korea trade surplus is growing too fast and the government has started taking steps to slow it down deputy prime minister kim mahn je said
he told press conference the government planned to increase investment speed up the opening of the local market to foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to hold the surplus at proper level
but he said the government would not allow the won to appreciate too much in short period of time
south korea has been under pressure from washington to revalue the won
wants south korea to cut its trade surplus with the which rose to billion dlrs in from billion dlrs in

our government projections of eight pct gnp growth five billion dlrs of current account surplus and pct growth in exports all seemed to be reasonable early this year
but now the surplus is growing faster than we expected he said
trade ministry officials said south korea exports rose pct to billion dlrs in the first three months of this year while imports rose only pct to billion dlrs
kim said the swing of south korea current account to surplus of billion dlrs in from an mln dlr deficit in was very significant
the surplus enabled the country to reduce its foreign debt last year for the first time
south korea foreign debt which fell to billion dlrs in from billion in is still among the largest in asia
this huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of the major constraints on our development last year was major turning point for the korean economy kim said
kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio of foreign debt to the country gnp to about pct in from about pct in
the government however does not want to accelerate reducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus he said
kim said sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflation and lead to trade friction with seoul major trading partners particularly the united states
we need surplus because we have to reduce our debt but we are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at proper level kim said

economic spotlight australian markets booming australian markets are booming as foreign fund managers redirect capital away from the united states and other traditional markets analysts said
high short term interest rates bullish stock market and an increasingly stable currency reflect massive inflow of fresh funds in the last two months largely from japanese and investors analysts polled by reuters said
fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in and have settled on australia britain and canada as they diversify from volatile dollar instruments they said
one percentage point fall in key year bonds rates in the past month record share prices and month high for the currency of dlrs all illustrated the inflow
official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital are not available but brokers said they received almost daily inquiries from japan and the united states
these people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about and they don know what to do with it
some of that is ending up here with the attraction of high interest rates and reasonable currency stability national australia bank ltd economist brian hamley said
there is flight to quality hamley said
australia may not be in the best economic position but there aren too many other countries where you want to put your money
the stronger australian dollar was also attracting investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against the volatility of the unit analysts said
we re looking more favoured market than perhaps the where some people would be concerned about the value of the dollar lloyds bank nza ltd chief economist will buttrose said
why not put the money in australia where entry is cheap and the currency looks stable
but turning that capital into more permanent productive investment depends on government economic policy he said
it will only disappear if people lose confidence in the direction in the economy buttrose said adding that offshore investors would carefully watch the government promised tough economic statement on may
while happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding interest unobtainable elsewhere fund managers could just as easily reverse the flow particularly the japanese who were badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the australian dollar and hefty jumps in bond rates analysts said
it will remain very edgy money
if something was not to be delivered if the statement wasn considered tough enough one might see substantial outflow buttrose said
offshore investors are eager to see australia take tough economic decisions to curb its billion dlr foreign debt and stubborn current account deficit analysts said
they are giving us the benefit of the doubt and think they would like to leave the money here buttrose said
reserve bank policy has also reflected the increased interest in investment in australia and the need to shield japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations
reserve governor bob johnston last week acknowledged an element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency policy when he said authorities could not take their eyes off the yen because of the crucial role of japanese investors
analysts said they believed the reserve bank had worked successfully in recent months to keep the australian dollar within the range of to yen
apart from its recovery against weak dollar the australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on trade weighted basis in the last three weeks
offshore buying has also played role in the booming australian share market
it has followed wall street and other markets but is also setting its own trend in response to the weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into equities particularly in the gold sector
the key all ordinaries index rose to record today nearly pct above its level at the end of while the gold index has nearly doubled to record in the same period
the property sector is also sought after with japanese companies that have invested heavily in the united states in recent years turning their attention to undervalued real estate particularly in the tourism field
analysts pointed to the recent sale of sydney five star regent hotel to japanese interests for more than mln dlrs as indicative of the type of property being sought
they think they find good value real estate here which with long term and fixed capital investment is the kind of investment australia needs buttrose added
economic spotlight kuwaiti economy kuwait oil reliant and debt ridden economy has started to pull out of nosedive but oil prices will determine the pace of recovery bankers and economists say
crucial will be the ability of the member opec to hold oil prices around new benchmark of dlrs barrel in the northern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens
bankers estimate the economy measured in terms of gross domestic product gdp shrank pct in real terms last year after contracting pct the year before
this was after taking into account inflation in consumer prices of pct in slowing to pct in
factors depressing economic activity include the year old iran iraq war on kuwait doorstep which threatens the emirate vital oil export lifeline through the gulf and has sapped business confidence
but sentiment received much needed boost in september when after series of piecemeal steps to combat debt crisis caused by the crash of local stock market comprehensive new debt settlement program was introduced
the share crash result of speculative spree in forward trading left billion dlrs of post dated cheques in default
the cheques were also used as collateral for consumer spending thus generating an informal credit system
much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are still owed by individuals and companies
there was some billion dinars about billion dlrs in outstanding bank credit at the end of of which one quarter to one third was estimated by bankers to rank as bad or doubtful debt
but the government has repeatedly said it will not allow any banks to go under
the new debt settlement scheme entails rescheduling of problem credit over to years depending on whether debtors have regular cash flows or not

kuwait is better placed than any other opec country to ride out the oil glut bankers and economists say
kuwait has an opec quota of barrels per day bpd compared with production capacity of mln bpd mentioned last year by oil minister sheikh ali al khalifa al sabah
but strategic diversification into downstream operations in europe several years ago and hefty refining investment at home gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell over one half of its output as high grade refined oil products
oil industry sources say kuwait is able to get an average dlrs barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed product such as gas oil kerosene and naphtha rather than as crude
bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason for cautious optimism
other reasons are low domestic inflation bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent years and signs government spending on productive sectors will remain steady
external accounts are in good shape with an estimated billion dinar current account surplus in pct below that for but still an achievement in the recession hit gulf

it depends on oil prices one said
this summer is important

san miguel deal hit by more lawsuits bid by san miguel corp smc lt sanm mn to buy back mln sequestered shares from united coconut planters bank ucpb has been hit by two new lawsuits sources in the philippine food and brewery company said
manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring ucpb from selling the shares which represent pct of smc outstanding capital stock of mln shares until hearings on april on petition filed by eduardo cojuangco former chairman of both smc and ucpb
cojuangco said the coconut industry investment fund ciif and mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares
cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by ucpb and represented blue chip investment
his petition said ucpb plans to sell the shares to smc were serious breach of fiduciary duties
the smc sources said the proposed share sale could also be held up by second derivative suit filed before the securities and exchange commission sec by eduardo de los angeles government nominee on the company board
de los angeles who represents smc minority stockholders asked the sec to block the transaction approved last week by the company board
on april the board sanctioned the repurchase of the sequestered shares for billion pesos at pesos per share
de los angeles told the sec the company retained earnings of billion pesos would be wiped out by the purchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of dividends
de los angeles said the share purchase would also violate an smc agreement with its creditors to maintain to debt to equity ratio
he quoted smc chief financial director ramon del rosario as telling the board that the transaction would boost the ratio to to
in petitioning the sec de los angeles amended an earlier suit two weeks ago in which he charged smc chairman andres soriano iii and nine other directors of violating their duties
de los angeles earlier complaint related to smc assuming last december mln dlr loan contracted by smc hong kong subsidiary lt neptunia corp for down payment on the shares
the loan assumption was again ratified by last week board meeting
an arbitration panel set up by president corazon aquino to resolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by april
the amended suit filed by eduardo de los angeles is part of continuing attempt by certain elements in complete disregard of the facts and with questionable motives to delay an early disposition of the sequestered shares san miguel corp said in statement
coming as it does when san miguel corp and ucpb have reached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of payment this suit is in direct contravention of the government expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement of the controversy by april the statement added
san miguel spokesman said he had no comment on cojuangco court petition adding any statement coming from us might be interpreted as adversarial
meanwhile ramon diaz the head of government panel which sequestered the shares last year said soriano was not eligible to buy the major portion of the shares because he was united states citizen
the sequestered shares are split into mln shares which can only be owned by filipinos and mln shares which are available to foreign buyers
smc sources said soriano personally was not among prospective buyers
they said the shares would be purchased by the lt soriano group of companies smc neptunia and unnamed institutional investors
soriano was named as one of the buyers in bid in march for mln shares controlled by ucpb
the sale was aborted when diaz presidential commission on good government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were owned by cojuangco close associate of former president ferdinand marcos
cojuangco lives in self imposed exile in the
the shares grew to mln after pct stock dividend announced last june
we have no objection to soriano buying the shares diaz told reuters
but everything is on hold now
the smc spokesman said he did not know if the controversy would be resolved before the company annual stockholders meeting scheduled for may
san miguel corp reported sales revenue of billion pesos in pct above its billion peso sales in
it said unaudited net profit was in the neighbourhood of mln pesos an increase of about pct over
rain boosts central queensland sugar cane crop good rains of one to four inches in the past days have boosted moisture stressed sugar cane crops in the mackay burdekin region of queensland central coast an australian sugar producers association spokesman said
as previously reported the region has been undergoing severe dry spell partly relieved by scattered rainfall since december following the virtual failure of the summer wet season
mills in the area have been reporting that their crops are beginning to look healthy and greener and are putting on growth since the rains began the spokesman said from brisbane
although the mackay burdekin crop outlook is much better than it was there will be some cane losses the spokesman said
but is too early to say what they will be and more rain is needed to restore sub soil moisture
elsewhere in far north queensland the bundaberg region and southern queensland the cane is in excellent condition and some mills are forecasting record crops he said
initial crop estimates will probably be compiled towards the end of may he said
the cane crush normally runs from june to december

poehl warns against further dollar fall bundesbank president karl otto poehl said weaker dollar would be risky and further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained west german economic growth
in speech to the institute of contempory german affairs here poehl said it would be an extremely risky policy to aim for further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit
he said the united states could face vicious circle of depreciation inflation and more depreciation if it took that route
poehl noted west germany had already taken steps to meet
demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy accelerating tax cuts cutting interest rates and tolerating above target money supply growth
he said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for january to the beginning of this year but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the west german parliament
but there were also limits to the impact west germany could accept on exports from rising mark he said
poehl said west germany relied on exports for about one third of its gross national product so substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home
further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth he said
poehl said the bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade had given some extra leeway
but poehl said west germany now faced difficult dilemma over monetary policy
the underlying rate of inflation was now two pct not the reported negative inflation rates last year and west germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments
for the time being we will have to focus our policy more on the external side and we can live with more expansionary money supply
but we must be very careful he said
he said he shared some of the concern about japan trade surpluses which affected european countries as well as the united states
poehl welcomed the so called louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries saying the importance of the february agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated
all partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level and that further changes would damage growth he said
this was remarkable change in attitude especially on the part of our american colleagues he said
but he said there was still danger that the correction of the dollar value could overshoot

proxmire outlines insider trading legislation senate banking committee chairman william proxmire wis said he planned to introduce legislation shortly to require greater public disclosure of corporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders
speaking to the national association of manufacturers proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased the chance that congress will act to curb abuses
we are proposing legislation that would provide for more disclosure would be fairer to all shareholders and would insure that takeovers are properly financed he said
among the provisions the bill would reduce the threshold for notifying the securities and exchange commission that investor or group has acquired percentage of stock in company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within days proxmire said
in addition there would be pre notificaton requirement that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have to filed with the sec
proxmire said the pre notification requirement was meant to prevent arbitragers from having jump on the general public in knowing about coming takeover attempts
proxmire said he would call for extending the period that tender offer must be kept open under the williams act to business days from the current business days
his bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring company violated the time period on the tender offer
to correct abuses in the financing of takeovers proxmire said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin requirments are properly enforced
the federal reserve board has pct margin requirement for purchasing stock but proxmire said it is not generally enforced in hostile takeovers
rather the groups or individuals leading takeover declare that they can raise the capital for takeover without actually putting any of their own money proxmire said
he said his bill would allow private suits for damages for failure to meet the federal reserve pct margin requirements
the bill also would require more disclose when several investors form an alliance in hostile takeover
when pickens and icahn get together we want people to know about it proxmire said
proxmire said he favored the approach used in britain towards two tiered tender offers that insures that all shareholders recieve equal treatment
he said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover defensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills
proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later this month and predicted the senate committee would act this spring
he said he was hopeful congress could pass bill this year

stoltenberg sees moves to strengthen paris accord west german finance minister gerhard stoltenberg said today meetings of major industrial countries would look at ways of strengthening the paris accord on stabilizing foreign exchange rates
stoltenberg told journalists he saw no fundamental weakness of the february agreement of the group of five countries and canada to keep exchange rates near the then current levels
but he declined to say what measures would be discussed ahead of communique of the group of seven ministers later today
stoltenberg and bundesbank president karl otto poehl said the importance of the paris agreement also known as the louvre accord had been underestimated
stoltenberg said there is greater agreement now among major countries than six months ago at the time of the annual meeting of the international monetary fund and world bank marked by sharp discord between the united states and its major trading partners
there is no fundamental weakness of the paris accord he said
we will be looking at ways of strengthening it but do not want to discuss that here
stoltenberg said the louvre agreement was working despite slight firming of the yen against the dollar
and poehl noted that the dollar mark parity was unchanged since february without the bundesbank having had to sell marks to support the dollar
the louvre agreement has been honored by the market he said
poehl said west germany had lived up to its side of the bargain in paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to be accelerated as way of stimulating growth
poehl said however that japan had not yet fulfilled its pledges for economic stimulation
and we will have to see if the united states is able to do what they promised in paris on reducing the budget deficit and get it through congress he added
stoltenberg reiterated west german concern about further fall in the dollar noting that the mark was up pct against the dollar and nearly pct on trade weighted basis
you cannot expect that to go unnoticed in an economy

dutch sugar beet planting half finished roughly half of this year expected hectare dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground spokesman for suiker unie the largest sugar processor in the netherlands told reuters
conditions are generally good and the average sowing date for the crop is expected to be around april against april last year and year average of april the spokesman added
it is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can expect when it comes to harvest in september but at least the crop is off to very good start he said
last year the netherlands planted record hectares of sugar beet and produced record mln tonnes of white sugar substantially more than the country combined and quota of tonnes
this year however self imposed quota system has been introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to hectares and reducing white sugar output to around tonnes to minimise the amount of non quota sugar produced
only farmers with record of growing suger beet have been allotted quotas
this is expected to prevent the area being boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar

further argentine coarse grain losses feared argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of march and beginning of april trade sources said
they said sunflower maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm dry weather which has allowed return to harvesting in some areas
however as showers fell intermittently after last weekend producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season
rains in the middle of last week reached an average of millimetres in parts of buenos aires province mm in cordoba in santa fe in entre rios and misiones in corrientes eight in chaco and in formosa
there was no rainfall in the same period in la pampa

however as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably reaching between and pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower
deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in cordoba la pampa and buenos aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again

petrochemical industry cheap oil feedstocks the weakened dollar and plant utilization rate approaching pct will propel the streamlined petrochemical industry to record profits this year with growth expected through at least major company executives predicted
this bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted gaf corp lt gaf privately held cain chemical inc and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants
oil companies such as ashland oil inc lt ash the kentucky based oil refiner and marketer are also shopping for money making petrochemical businesses to buy
see us poised at the threshold of golden period said paul oreffice chairman of giant dow chemical co lt dow adding there no major plant capacity being added around the world now
the whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones
analysts say the chemical industry biggest customers automobile manufacturers and home builders that use lot of paints and plastics are expected to buy quantities this year
petrochemical plants are currently operating at about pct capacity reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by to pct this year said john dosher managing director of pace consultants inc of houston
demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as pct he said
oreffice speaking at meeting of chemical engineers in houston said dow would easily top the mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history
in when oil prices were still above dlrs barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong dollar dow had profits of mln dlrs
believe the entire chemical industry is headed for record year or close to it oreffice said
gaf chairman samuel heyman estimated that the chemical industry would report pct gain in profits during
last year the domestic industry earned total of billion dlrs pct leap from
the turn in the fortunes of the once sickly chemical industry has been brought about by combination of luck and planning said pace john dosher
dosher said last year fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the american dollar was weakening against foreign currencies
that helped boost chemical exports
also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by middle eastern oil producers in the early
finally virtually all major chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses
the restructuring touched off flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts
gaf which made an unsuccessful attempt in to acquire union carbide corp lt uk recently offered three billion dlrs for borg warner corp lt bor chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals
another industry powerhouse grace lt gra has divested its retailing restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions
but some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities such as ethylene in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom designed for small group of buyers
companies like dupont lt dd and monsanto co lt mtc spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated dosher said
but think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market
some top chemical executives share the concern
the challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes gaf heyman cautioned
the shift from commodity chemicals may be ill advised
specialty businesses do not stay special long
houston based cain chemical created this month by the sterling investment banking group believes it can generate mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend
chairman gordon cain who previously led leveraged buyout of dupont conoco inc chemical business has spent billion dlrs since january to buy seven petrochemical plants along the texas gulf coast
the plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products
this kind of commodity chemical business will never be glamorous high margin business cain said adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually
garo armen an analyst with dean witter reynolds said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum wood and steel products
armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years provided the economy continues its modest rate of growth

cocoa exporters expected to limit sales major cocoa exporters are likely to limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world prices sources close to meeting of the cocoa producers alliance cpa said
the sources said the depressed world market had been one of the main topics discussed in closed door meeting of the member cpa which began on monday
they said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the buffer stock manager of new international cocoa pact in his effort to support prices
major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed operation rules for the buffer stock at meeting in london last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the market soon
prices under the weight of three successive cocoa surpluses recently fell to the level at which the manager has to buy cocoa under stock rules
the buffer stock aims to keep prices within pre set range by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise
the world cocoa price at present is just not interesting commented one delegate representing major cpa producer
another source said that with much of the october september world cocoa crop sold limiting sales in the near term concerns essentially next year harvest
the sources noted however that the cocoa industry in brazil the world number two producer is in private hands
this means limiting sales is more difficult than in major west african producers where sales are made or authorized by commodity marketing boards
the cpa includes the world top three producers ivory coast brazil and ghana and accounts for pct of all output

brazil grain harvest faces storage problems storage problems with brazil record grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln tonnes an agriculture ministry spokesman said
ministry spokesman leonardo brito speaking from brasilia told reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this year estimated crop of mln tonnes would be lost
he said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting but that most of it would stem from storage problems
brazil has storage capacity of mln tonnes theoretically sufficient for the crop
but brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed
the states of sao paulo parana and rio grande do sul had between them pct of the nation capacity but were responsible for only to pct of production
the biggest problems are concentrated in the centre west growing regions where rising production has outpaced storage capacity
brito said the centre west whose crops include soya and maize had between and pct of the nation grains production but only pct of its storage space
in addition to the poor distribution of storage units there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain brito said

the sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries

talking point burlington industries lt bur the largest textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners but now burlington industries inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate analysts said
the takeover spotlight fell today on burlington which rose to on speculation that investor asher edelman and dominion textiles inc of canada bought an almost five pct stake
published report said edelman and dominion jointly acquired stake in burlington and were weighing takeover offer
edelman would not comment and spokesman for montreal based dominion called the report just rumors
burlington said it did not know if the report was true
wall street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that edelman and dominion would be the victors if burlington actually came into play
arbitragers said past comments from dominion however added credence to the speculation
dominion has said that it was looking for takeover in the last year dominion unsuccessfully bid for avondale mills and has maintained mln dlr line of credit to be used for acquisition
dominion spokesman said canada largest textile producer has been negotiating with many textile companies but would not say whether burlington was among them
there have been acquisitions in this area
it not unusual that someone could be looking at burlington after the housecleaning they ve done said eileen gormley of thomson mckinnon
burlington sold its domestic operations which made sheets and other linens to stevens and co inc for mln dlrs last year
it also has reorganized management and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition gormley said
they ve pulled back so as not to be commodity marketer said gormley
she said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics burlington bought
masland which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry
in the past they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make she said
you look at their record over the year and think they re poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past gormley said
she estimated earnings of dlrs per share up from dlrs per share
some analysts today recommended clients not buy burlington at its current levels
edward johnson of johnson redbook said he recommends selling
he said he believes the stock is worth only about dlrs on takeover basis and about dlrs on an earnings basis
some arbitragers however said takeover values have been placed on the company of to dlrs per share
after asher edelman recent history lot of people don find him very credible anymore said one arbitrager
another however said edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesn win the target company
edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for lucky stores inc and fruehauf corp

japan in last ditch effort to avert tariffs senior japanese officials tomorrow open talks with american trade negotiators in last ditch effort to avert new high tariffs to be imposed on wide variety of japanese electronic exports
makoto kuroda vice minister of japan ministry of international trade and industry miti is to hold two days of meetings with the deputy trade representative michael smith and the under secretary of commerce bruce smart
the new tariffs to go into effect on april are in retaliation for japan failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to semiconductor shipments
they are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors including television and audio equipment and computers
both and japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the pct duties on mln dlrs worth of japanese shipments
president reagan announced the planned tariffs on march after he said that close monitoring of the july japanese semiconductor pact convinced officials that japan was not honoring the agreement
in making the annoucement reagan said am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide american industry with free and fair trade
trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at japan semiconductor trade practices which are said to have injured the semiconductor industry as congress which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues
congressional democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been reagan inaction to redress the growing trade deficit which last year reached billion dlrs
about one third of the deficit was with japan
reagan said there were recent signs japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it
kuroda said on leaving tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation
he told the daily newspaper ashai shimbun that reagan decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of miti power to control japanese traders
the united states has excessive expectations he said
to stabilize supply demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since will take some time
he also said that firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the japanese market

heineken sees higher profits wider penetration dutch brewer heineken nv said it hoped to maintain for number of years similar earnings growth to the pct increase in net profit achieved in despite continuing investments in reorganization program and efforts to extend world penetration
heineken last month reported net profit of mln guilders after mln in
chairman freddie heineken said the company europe leading beer producer with six pct of market share in said sales increased by pct to mln hectoliters
the volume increase was due mainly to rise in the where the brand amstel lite saw great demand and in europe where sales accounted for pct of the total
turnover despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker foreign currencies rose by pct to billion guilders
further consolidation of foreign companies including the increase of its stake in leading spanish brewery lt el aguila to pct new ventures and modernization particularly in french and spanish interests eroded profit margins
the company still planned to invest mln guilders this year in restructuring and marketing heineken said
heineken spanish activities should start yielding profit next year heineken said adding that its french operations had already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year
vice chairman gerard van schaik said the decision by the european court of justice in luxembourg to allow foreign beer into the closed west german market europe biggest beer market offered interesting possibilities for heineken
we have the beer but distribution and sales is the important point van schaik said adding that since the ruling heineken had been inundated by german traders seeking joint ventures
the question is not if we want to penetrate the german market but how we are to do it van schaik said adding that while the widely traveled germans seemed to be developing taste for foreign beer the internal structure was very regionalized
heineken board member hans coebergh responsible for african operations said he saw africa as one of the most important beer growth markets in the long term
he said the company present in africa since and with majority stakes in six breweries and interests in was hampered by the lack of hard currencies there
africa where beer consumption averages only nine liters per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions and currency risks nonetheless accounted for pct of total sales
on site production is rendered expensive by the high price of imports of essential ingredients
but heineken scientists have been looking at other possibilities
to balance the costs of imported malt heinken launched on the nigerian market new beer made of pct sorghum which had sold successfully coebergh said
heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw materials but coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were popular in rwanda
this is possibility but we could not possibly achieve the heineken flavor coebergh said
chairman heineken said the company seven year efforts to penetrate the soviet market had finally resulted this week in contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced
but again lack of hard currencies limited heineken market potential
heineken now has seven bars in moscow that are enjoying good sales but the bars only accept western money

takeover speculation has driven ual stock for several weeks
ual last month said new york real estate developer donald trump held position in its stock and that he also held discussions with its chairman

today rumors circulated that coniston partners were buying ual stock
ual jumped five to on volume of more than mln shares
united has got to consider this proposal
think the pilot proposal is realistic
don exptect them to take it but it could put some interesting options in front of ual management said timothy pettee bear stearns and co analyst
analysts have said ual made itself vulnerable to attack when it diversified away from its core airline
it added hertz rental cars westin and hilton international hotels in strategy to become travel service company
the strategy left its stock in slump and its pilots union concerned that the company was not focussing enough attention on its airline
ual has stood firm on its strategy
it is emphasizing its new focus by changing its name to allegis as of may one
but takeover speculation has escalated and wall street has been busy calculating break up values well in excess of dlrs per share
traders today described the buying in ual as widespread indicative to them that big institutions believe the stock is in play
market sources have said that although trump attracted attention to the stock the pilots proposal acted as catalyst kicking off new round of speculation and perhaps throwing the company into the hands of another buyer
the first domino is you have an investor with considerable stake
the second domino is the union
that type of attitude has been precursor to airline deals in the past said pettee
what interesting is the values are there
there something for everybody he said

fed heller says monetary growth to be slower robert heller member of the federal reserve board said he expects more modest levels of growth in the money supply this year
in my view this would not only be logical but also most desireable development he said in speech prepared for delivery to an economic forum at chapman college in orange calif text was released in washington
he said the effect of lower inflation and financial deregulation on monetary aggregates was now largely finished
consequently monetary growth may return to more modest levels heller said
he noted growth in the money supply slowed after mid january
would not be surprised at all if the monetary aggregates were to grow rather slowly during the balance of the year as well he added
heller said there was danger of renewed price inflation
the pricing behavior of american producers in response to price increases of their foreign competitors will be crucial for our economic future he said
widespread domestic price rises in response to rising import prices would generalize the inflationary forces emanating from the foreign trade sector and might not gain more market share for producers
return to the stagflation of the late may well be the result of such behavior pattern heller warned
he said we at the federal reserve will have to be disciplined in our conduct of monetary policy
heller said said the government should also exercise fiscal discipline and cut the deficit by spending restraint rather than new taxes
the imposition of new taxes would tend to rekindle inflation and certainly would not make us more competitive in international markets heller said
he said the economy should expand by nearly three pct during aided by higher exports to europe and canada
free trade agreement currently being negotiated with canada would be exceedingly helpful in allowing american producers to compete more effectively in that country heller said

the american consumer has little reason to feel confident about the safety of meat and poultry being offered to him today said rodney leonard executive director of the community nutrition institute
company management is less concerned about the risk to health than about raising plant output and company profits leonard told hearing of the house agriculture subcommittee on livestock dairy and poultry
kenneth morrison staff associate at the government accountability project said inspectors consistently disclose violations of federal law demonstrating serious breakdown in the entire inspection system
morrison told of chicken fat for flavoring being contaminated by intestines dragging in water trough used to flush away the condemned product fecal material human spit chewing gum and paper towels used by plant employees to blow their noses
donald houston administrator of the agriculture department food safety and inspection service fsis defended the government program calling it one of the most respected public health programs in the world
fsis inspects an estimated mln head of cattle and billion chicken and turkeys every year
houston said inspection programs have kept pace with change but conceded that the danger of chemical residues in the meat and poultry supply has increased
he also said that although he was confident the bacterium salmonella eventually could be eradicated it would take time and much money to contain the growing problem
salmonella which in extreme cases can cause death is found in approximately pct of broilers pct of raw pork and three to five pct of raw beef houston said
the number of reported cases has doubled over the past years he said to cases annually
we certainly really have not found an effective means of turning this disease around said rep james olin va the national research council recommended in that fsis intensify efforts to develop rapid diagnostic procedures for detecting microoganisms
but the meat and poultry industries have said such controls would cost too much
hopefully we will not overreact by installing unnecessarily complicated procedures that may become obstacles to the real goal of providing an increasingly safer more nutritious and economical meat supply for consumers stanley emerling executive vice president of the national association of meat purveyors said
blaylock speaking on behalf of food inspectors said new program allowing elimination of usda inspection functions at certain plants voids the law in letter and spirit and must be repealed or we will see rising consumer fraud and an epidemic of death and illness for which there will be no prevention nor legal recourse
subcommittee chairman charles stenholm tex
said the panel would hold hearing on salmonella june
chrysler lt renault delay am motors lt amo pact chrysler corp and regie natiionale des usines renault said they agreed to extend by up to two weeks the period for reaching definitive agreement on chrysler proposed billion dlr takeover of american motors corp

chrysler spokeswoman would not say whether some problem had cropped up in the talks
she stuck by the company statement that more time was needed because the talks are complex
that is our definition of the delay she said
under the previous agreement between chrysler and renault their letter of intent would be terminated on april nine or when an agreement was reached
but the letter could be amendend by written agreement by both companies
the chrysler spokeswoman said we are still working toward definitive agreement
said another chrysler official who is not part of the talks but who would be told if the deal were in trouble there are no glitches

wojnilower sees drop in interest rates the federal reserve will promote lower interest rates this year to sustain world economic growth first boston corp managing director albert wojnilower said

deficit cuts seen unable to cure trade deficit financial analysts say they are pleased with congressional moves to trim next year federal budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help improve the trade deficit or buoy the economy
the house of representatives is expected to vote tomorrow to approve trillion dollar budget blueprint for the coming fiscal year that reduces the deficit by billion dlrs
similarly the senate budget committee has approved plan that would cut federal red ink by about billion dlrs next year
in terms of the economy billion dlrs is infinitesimal so cuts of this magnitude will have little impact on the economy and the trade deficit said stanley collander touche ross federal budget policy analyst
at best it will have small positive effect collander said in an interview
federal reserve board chairman paul volcker has repeatedly told congress that cutting federal red ink would go long way to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar
the government has attempted to remedy the trade imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar
but volcker has warned that further fall in the dollar value is fraught with danger
such decline he has said could refuel inflation as imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit
in addition in february officials meeting with other major industrialized nations in paris agreed that the value of the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates should be stabilized at around current levels
as part of that agreement japan and west germany agreed to take steps to stimulate their economies and the united states agreed to cut its budget deficit
the alternative to driving down the dollar any further as way to deal with the trade deficit volcker said recently is to reduce consumption particularly federal spending
if you don deal with the budget deficit everything else you do is going to be counterproductive volcker said in recent testimony before the senate banking committee
volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the government purse strings than have the fed tighten the credit supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the united states
analysts say that fed tightening now could choke off the current modest economic expansion and threaten recession
kemper financial services economist john silvia stressed that any deficit reduction was better than none
but he said the size of the cuts under consideration were not enough to give the federal reserve board the flexibility it needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar from plunging further in world exchange markets
there no doubt that some deficit reduction helps but if your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the fed flexibility to conduct monetary policy then the answer is it not enough silvia told reuters
the trade deficit has become one of the government most vexing and persistent problems
the deficit was billion dlrs and there is as yet little indication that this year figure will be any lower though administration officials have predicted it will drop by about to billion dlrs by year end
in the past volcker has joked that he never lost sleep worrying whether congress would cut too much fat from the federal budget
on the other hand he also has made it clear he is not attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for the period by last year gramm rudman balanced budget law
while the new law set ceiling of billion dlrs for next year federal deficit both the house and senate budget committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall short of the deficit reduction goal by about billion dlrs
for political reasons to billion dlrs is about the most you re going to get out of congress at the present time said touche ross collander
to do something more than that would be extraordinary remarkable and very very difficult
collander said the real danger for congress was to end up short of the deficit reduction goal set by its budget panels
to an extent this has become the minimum acceptable reduction level he explained
anything less than that will now look like failure to wall street
the budget plan now under debate on the house floor would lower an estimated billion dlr deficit for the year beginning on october one to about billion dlrs by cutting defense and domestic programs by billion dlrs from their anticipated spending levels for next year
the senate budget committee has called for deficit of nearly billion dlrs with about billion dlrs in new taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts

colombia coffee registrations remain open colombia coffee export registrations remain open and there are no plans to close them since new marketing policy means an unlimited amount can be registered gilberto arango president of the private exporters association said
the philosophy of the new policy is not to close registrations
nobody so far said may would be closed he told reuters
on march colombia opened registrations for april and may for an unlimited amount
without giving breakdowns arango said private exporters had registered bags this calendar year up to april or roughly bags per month slightly lower than the average in recent years
he estimated the amount of bags registered by the national coffee growers federation at about the same meaning total of about bags registered and sold per month by colombia
the only change that could happen is because of the volume we would be told that from such date registrations would be for june shipment etc arango said

more american brands lt amb acquisitions seen american brands inc mln dlrs acquisition of national distillers and chemical corp liquor business is expected to be one of series of acquisitions by the tobacco company analysts said
they were very frustrated with their inability to get chesebrough
they said they were looking for an acquisition
it doesn surprise me that they came up with another one said allan kaplan of merrill lynch and co american brands failed late last year in its billion dlrs bid for chesebrough ponds inc when unilever agreed to buy the company
but since then wall street has been speculating that american brands would find another candidate to help reduce its earnings exposure to tobacco
this is just typical said george thompson of prudential bache securities
there going to be more to come here
american brands had to make an acquisition because tobacco is still significant part of earnings
their position is little less favorable than philip morris and rj reynolds he said
cash flow from its low growth tobacco but the tobacco business does require great amounts of capital expenditures
it can therefore use its funds to make acquisitions

bundesbank calls for central bank cooperation bundesbank board member claus koehler called on central banks of major industrialised nations to cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies
in lecture at the university of surrey pre released here koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was protectionism and control on capital movements
central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have them he said
he added that west german growth forecasts would have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop to marks from above two marks at the start of
koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets had parted company with transactions in goods services and investments
it was the scale of speculative transactions that determined market trends
speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to grow
to reverse such rise in the money stock interest rates would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off
in other words the monetary policy measures required are different from and sometimes diametrically opposed to those needed when the money stock is increasing as result of mounting economic activity koehler said
the dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive current account deficit
but attempts to keep the depreciation going by talking the dollar down posed problems
the sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep rise in the cost of imports and sharp fall in the cost of european imports
but the volume effect of falling imports to the and rising imports to europe would take time to make itself felt compared with the price effect
hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going further than would be necessary to adjust the current account over the medium term koehler said
reduction in the current account deficit would occur only if the growth rate of gnp was higher than domestic demand
in japan and west germany by contrast domestic demand should rise faster than gnp
in germany this did indeed happen in koehler said
if further appreciation of the dollar was to be prevented the current account deficit could be offset by an inflow of foreign funds into the
but only if there was an appropriate interest rate differential would europe and japan look for financial investment in the
when selecting monetary policy instruments central bank had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions
koehler said the bundesbank was changing money market rates by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market and its substantial impact on exchange rates
it was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of price stability economic growth and full employment but also to tackle international problems like the exchange rate problem the debt problem and the current account problem
strategy had to be designed that helped the safeguarding of non inflationary economic growth in an international monetary system largely free of disruptions koehler said
given the system of floating exchange rates it was necessary for central banks to agree to intervene
it sufficed to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over the next few years and intervention points should not be set because they were only testing points for the market he said
in order to keep the international monetary system free of disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but also cooperate on interest rate policies koehler said

economic spotlight telecom is key japan ministry japan little known ministry of posts and telecommunications mpt has emerged as an international force to be reckoned with political analysts said
mpt thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the and britain is in position of strength due to its control of lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians they said
the ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of key industrial sector telecommunications and information said one diplomatic source
they are potent political force the diplomatic source said
but mpt is finding domestic political prowess does not always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy analysts said
the ministry was minor ministry and its people were not so internationalized said waseda university professor mitsuru uchida
suddenly they re standing at the centre of the world community and in that sense they re at loss as to how to face the situation
most recently the ministry has been embroiled in row with london over efforts by britain cable and wireless plc to keep major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in japan lucrative overseas telephone business
the ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival groups arguing the market cannot support more than one competitor to kokusai denshin denwa co ltd which now monopolizes the business
it has also opposed major management role in the planned merger for any non japanese overseas telecommunications firm on the grounds that no such international precedent exists
the ministry stance has outraged both london which has threatened to retaliate and washington which says the merger plan is evidence of japan failure to honour pledges to open its telecommunications market
washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it says have limited access for firms to japan car telephone and satellite communications market
much of mpt new prominence stems from the growth of the sector it regulates
what has been happening is an important shift in the economy which makes the ministry very important place said james abegglen head of the consulting firm asia advisory service inc decision to open the telecommunications industry to competition under new set of laws passed in has boosted rather than lessened mpt authority analysts said
with the legal framework eased they became the de facto legal framework said bache securities japan analyst darrell whitten
close links with the powerful political faction of the ruling liberal democratic party ldp nurtured by former prime minister kakuei tanaka are another key to mpt influence the analysts said
other factions ignored mpt in the but the tanaka faction was forward looking and
recognized the importance of mpt uchida said
many former bureaucrats became members of the influential political group he added
the ministry also has power in the financial sector due to the more than billion yen worth of deposits in the postal savings system analysts said
mpt has helped block finance ministry plans to deregulate interest rates on small deposits key element in financial liberalisation since the change would remove the postal savings system ability to offer slightly higher rates than banks they said
diplomatic sources frustrated with what they see as mpt obstructionist and protectionist posture have characterized the ministry as feudal
critics charge mpt with protecting its own turf limiting competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its wing
providing consumers with the best service at the lowest price takes back seat to such considerations they said
but many of the ministry actions are not unlike those of its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the western world including britain several analysts said
the united states is really the odd man out abegglen said
for government to take the view that it wants to keep order in utilities markets is not an unusual and or unreasonable view he said

german bankers remarks revive talk of rate cut remarks by two leading central bankers sparked renewed speculation in financial markets that cut in the west german three pct discount rate may be under discussion currency dealers said
bundesbank board member claus koehler said in speech that monetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflows required cuts in interest rates
separately west berlin state central bank president dieter hiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall below its lowest ever point of pct
he made clear that he was not making forecast on interest rates however
currency dealers here and in the far east said the dollar gained slight background support from the speculation
but german dealers noted that the bundesbank kept the pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the money market this week dashing some expectations that it may either offer lower fixed rate money or offer reduced minimum rate and let the strength of banks demands set the allocation rate
it allocated billion marks in new liquidity much less than the billion leaving the market as prior pact expired
this further weakened sentiment the bundesbank could move to more accommodative monetary stance dealers said
koehler said in speech in surrey england speculative capital inflows may cause monetary growth regardless of whether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell
in other words the monetary policy measures required are different from and sometimes diametrically opposed to those needed when the money stock is increasing as result of mounting economic activity
though koehler was known to be the most liberal of the generally monetarist bundesbank board his comments marked the first time cuts in rates had been concretely suggested as counterpoint to overly strong monetary growth dealers said

european markets react quietly to communique european currency markets reacted quietly to the communique with comments from bankers and dealers ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to surprise that the markets should have expected so much
the dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies and traded in narrow range after the communique which reaffirmed support for the paris accord on currency stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it
dealers in frankfurt and zurich saw the dollar remaining broadly entrenched in its current trading range
the dollar is likely to stay within range of to marks said gisela steinhaeuser senior dealer at chase bank ag
she said there was some resistance to further climbs
however she said the dollar could break out of the range with major surprises such as worse than expected
merchandise trade deficit due next tuesday
theodor stadelmann dealer with bank julius baer and co ltd in zurich said he expects the dollar to hold steady against the mark and swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen possibly to yen
milan banker shared stadelmann view saying he expects dollar yen range of in the short term
london traders said the communique failed to curb underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank operators to test the downside
concern that finance ministers and officials still in washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of currency stabilisation kept players sidelined along with worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the near term the traders said
most paris dealers expressed disappointment at the communique saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar downward trend
traders in several centres said the market would look for fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to defend current ranges which the communique said were broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the louvre meeting
dave jouhin senior dealer at midland bank in london said they re going to put somebody resolve to the test soon
the february trade data may provide the trigger dealers said
however some dealers said london based operators would be unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long easter weekend
they saw near term technical support at marks and yen and resistance about marks and yen
chase bank steinhaeuser and other frankfurt dealers said the communique guaranteed relatively calm and stable market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme volatility seen in the first few months of this year
one dealer at german bank said the wording of the communique made clear the leading nations did not want further dollar drop and this was supporting the dollar
the german dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to marks broadly seen as its upper limit within the louvre accord supposed currency target range
swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were ready for period of mainly sideways movement
but milan dealers were sceptical about the communique contributing to greater stability
nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar big boost said one dealer while another italian banker said he expects the dollar to trade between and german marks in the next three months
swiss monetary source who asked not to be named said the communique had been in line with realistic expectations and should not have produced disappointment
the problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and trade policies to redress current imbalances are of different timescale than currency markets operate on the source told reuters this is political process which takes time
alois schwietert chief economist at swiss bank corp in basle also questioned the tone of disappointment evident on currency markets today
did people really expect patent remedy
bank economists in paris noted yesterday meeting was only the first in series and said the market would watch carefully in the next few weeks for any changes in positions
senior economist with banque indosuez said the focus was now on trade and growth rather than interest rates
any move by japan and west germany to boost their economic growth could lead to quick change in the
dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary in pushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming months while central banks appear resolved to use their muscle to support the paris accord
german money market split on lower rate prospects remarks by central bankers raised some hopes the bundesbank will cut rates on securities repurchase pacts but operators remained divided on the likelihood of move in the near term money market dealers said
comments by bundesbank board member claus koehler yesterday that rate cuts were needed to curb money supply growth from speculative capital inflows and by west berlin state central bank president dieter hiss that there was no natural lower limit to the discount rate had however no immediate impact
call money declined to pct from pct but the drop was tied to extra liquidity in the market dealers said
dealers said the bundesbank latest liquidity allotment this week dashed some hopes of lower rates
the bundesbank allotted only billion marks yesterday in new liquidity in repurchase pact at an unchanged rate of pct thus subtracting some billion marks from the market as an outgoing billion pact expired
but some dealers said the smaller volume awarded by the pact was in line with present liquid money market conditions and did not exlude cut in the repurchase pact rate soon to pct if money market rates continue at present levels
the next opportunity for the bundesbank to lower rates on repurchase pacts will be in tender expected next tuesday
bundesbank officials have already said they favour more discreet rate adjustments through repurchase pacts rather than the more public adjustment of leading rates
the bundesbank may either set fixed allocation rate and allow banks to tender for the volume as has been the case since it lowered its discount rate january or else it may allow banks to tender for the rate and set the volume itself
dealers expect volume of the tender to be lower than the billion marks flowing out to offset other incoming funds
some seven billion marks is expected to flow in next week

total revenue was eight pct lower in at billion guilders vs billion guilders in
the company said its revenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and change in accounting practice

revenue from dutch operations rose five pct in mainly due to its life insurance business
health insurance revenues in the netherlands also rose despite notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and higher personal risks
damage insurances made losses mainly due to car damage insurances
aegon did not specify the loss
in the united states revenue in guilders from health and life insurance was lower
aegon said this was due to change in accounting for

in large number of new insurance products emerged in the netherlands and the aegon said

at news conference after today meeting miyazawa said the ministers and central bank governors did not believe totally new statement was needed
the speculative selling did not reflect economic fundamentals and since the fundamentals had not changed only reaffirmation of the goals of the paris accord was needed he said
he also noted that this test of the nations resolve had concentrated on the yen while other currencies especially the mark had remained stable
miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since the paris accord was not worth being called fundamental
as said at time of louvre agreement the expression of current level is rather vague idea he said
the yen movement in the past several weeks is within the range agreed in paris in febraury he said
it was better to give vague expression than pin pointing level which could have an adverse impact on the market miyazawa said
asked why only japan was committed to fresh measures in the statement he said japan was exceptional among the seven because the yen appreciated against the dollar while other major currencies largely have been stable
he also said japan ruling liberal democratic party has justed adoped package to reflate the economy while other nations are not supposed to produce new measures in short period since the paris agreement

bundesbank sees no change in monetary course the bundesbank sees no current reason to change monetary course vice president helmut schlesinger told reuters in telephone interview
schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks yesterday by bundesbank board member claus koehler and west berlin state central bank president dieter hiss which dealers said revived some speculation that german interest rate cuts may once again be under discussion
schlesinger said he had no comment on the remarks of his two central bank council colleagues

much is going better than the impression gained by the public from the january figures which have been in the meantime superseded he said

asked however if the bundesbank could move to cut rates on repurchase agreements at the setting of the next repurchase tender due next tuesday schlesinger said since the central bank council gives its opinion on this theme only every days this is hardly probable
responding to the question whether the bundesbank had moved away from policy of targetting monetary growth toward one of targetting currency rates schlesinger said he could have no comment on the subject while negotiations were still in progress in washington

said to view meeting as major success the united states which has long sought japanese action to stimulate its economy appears to be satisfied tokyo latest package is major development and allows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreement to stabilize currencies
monetary sources said they believed that treasury secretary james baker considered tokyo package announced yesterday to be major stimulation of the japanese economy
but yesterday statement by seven leading industrial powers endorses the yen rise from around to the dollar the level at the february paris accord to about today
and the initial reaction of currency markets in the far east demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced that currencies yet reflect economic fundamentals even though the countries appear to do so
the yen sank below at one point despite intervention by the bank of japan
kiichi miyazawa japan finance minister said the movement since paris was consistent with currency trading ranges the nations agreed to defend in the february talks
would say that what has happened to the yen in the past several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the discussions in paris miyazawa said yesterday
the supplementary budget worth about billion dlrs was announced by the ruling liberal democratic party on the eve of miyazawa departure for washington to attend yesterday meetings of leading industrial nations
in strongly worded statement terming the japanese action extraordinary and urgent the meeting reaffirmed the paris accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals or economic reality
the group of seven the united states japan west germany france britain italy and canada therefore repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to foster exchange rate stability
the cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central bank intervention of billion to billion dlrs to halt the dollar fall
while relatively unsuccessful the scale of intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent years
monetary sources also said they understood that secretary baker considered the meeting to be extremely successful in the light of the japanese announcement
they also said there was growing feeling among the finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over medium term policies has replaced the bickering over short term differences in past meetings
west germany whose currency has not risen anything like the yen since the paris agreement appears from the face of yesterday statement to have won acceptance from other countries that its exchange rate is acceptable
bonn finance minister gerhard stoltenberg argues that major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance between west germany and japan trade surpluses and america trade deficit have already taken place
no mention was made however of the commitment to cut the budget deficit even though it is implied in the reafffirmation of paris
european nations and japan believe deficit cuts are essential to curbing the record trade shortfall that reached nearly billion dlrs last year
similar argument was made on capitol hill earlier this week by federal reserve board chairman paul volcker
further sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would clearly pose substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could undermine confidence in future financial stability he said
volcker warned further dollar fall might force the politically independent fed to drive up interest rates
monetary sources said that privately west germany welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own currency remained relatively stable against the unit
bonn and other european nations worry that once the weak dollar blunts tokyo export drive to the united states the japanese monolith will concentrate on european markets
the ministers meanwhile also continued talks on making their policy coordination more binding and one canadian finance minister michael wilson said good progress was made
wilson said they will meet before the june economic summit to prepare report for the leaders of the seven nations
the united states and france backed by the international monetary fund want the seven to agree on ranges or norms for limited number of economic objectives such as growth inflation monetary conditions trade balances and current account balances
sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in consultations between the countries on whether corrective action should be required
but the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives has bonn and london worried monetary sources say because it implies washington is moving in the direction of target zones
the sources said the reagan administration unsuccessfully sounded out its allies on system of target zones to limit currency fluctuations just before the february meeting
the concept is much more rigid one than the secret ranges of the paris accord and would mark sharp departure from the relatively free currency markets of recent years
bank of france leaves intervention rate unchanged the bank of france said it left its intervention rate unchanged at pct when it injected funds in the market against first category paper in today money market intervention tender

global economic slowdown raises new debt fears the global economy is expected to weaken this year adding new worries to an already serious poverty outlook economic analysts said
for finance ministers and central bankers attending this week semi annual meetings of the international monetary fund and world bank the new figures released by the imf add an additional concern
the fund estimated world output would only grow by pct this year versus pct last year and pct in
in the industrial countries gross national product measure of all goods and services was expected to decline to pct this year compared with pct in the imf said
for the developing countries the gross domestic product another measure of economic growth was expected to fall to pct from pct last year
the new figures are considered major disappointment to the poorest countries
they had hoped that new vitality in the industrial countries brought on by sharp decline in oil prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope with growing mounds of debt
imf officials discussing their outlook said they believed the industrial country economies would move up to an annual growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade
economic analysts and the imf have been saying for some time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth
since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier states for markets for their products as well as financial assistance economic weakness in the developed nations economies poses fundamental worries
debtor countries including the very poorest states have only few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange including the key one of exports
the economy which is in its fifth year of expansion has served as mainstay for developing country exports but it too is seen as being rather feeble this year growing by only pct according to the imf
for this reason and because of high trade deficit the united states has been pressuring japan and west germany to ignite their economies but with little apparent success
the imf study also examines the course of the dollar and the curious lack of impact it has had on the trade deficit
reagan administration officials have been saying that the impact is now beginning to show up although it has been much slower than expected
the imf observed in its world economic outlook that it has to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to work through to payments flows probably at least three years to get resonably complete effect
the report added however the adjustments may take even more time on this occasion
spanish employers worried by high interest rates the head of spain employers federation jose maria cuevas said employers were worried about the government monetary policies because high real interest rates were hampering investment
he told news conference wage pacts signed so far this year were not endangering the government five pct inflation target
the government perceived need to control inflation by keeping tight rein on credit was unnecessary he said
high real interest rates were attracting an influx of speculative foreign capital which was undercutting the government target for monetary growth cuevas said
spain most closely watched measure of money supply liquid assets in public hands grew at an annualised rate of pct in march against pct in december last year and target range of to pct for
to combat this the bank of spain has raised its call money rate times so far this year to pct at present from at end
cuevas said employers were heeding the government call to hold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new wage pacts averaging pct in the first quarter of
these agreements covered less than pct of spanish workers cuevas said with the rest still in wage negotiations
he said spain current wave of strikes mainly affected the state sector where the government is trying to impose its five pct wage ceiling
cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in spain foreign trade balance
the trade deficit in the first two months of totalled billion pesetas pct increase over the corresponding period last year
however employers did not favour devaluation of the peseta to correct the imbalance

lead prices rise on finely balanced physicals lead prices have risen this week against background of finely balanced physical sector traders said
further gains are possible if the ussr steps up its buying or if labour problems develop in north america they added
london metal exchange lme prices are unusually buoyant at time of year when seasonal demand is normally slackening and prices tending to drift lower
this buoyancy is generally attributed by traders to the low level of lme stocks and steady if unspectacular physical demand in the northern hemisphere finding supplies curtailed
the supply problems are not new but are beginning to be felt by market in which as peak winter demand tails off stocks usually build fast and availability increases traders said
the lower supply levels result from number of different factors around the globe
delayed shipments from peru to mediterranean countries because of production and transport problems lack of spanish exports since the closure last year of cia la cruz smelter at linares and lower output in morocco and greece have all meant additional demand being directed to merchants who in turn have been drawing on lme stocks
in addition broken hill associated smelters port pirie south australia smelter is halting production for five weeks for maintenance
although the company said it would meet commitments this will put further pressure on stocks
and the company doe run has kept its tonnes per year boss montana smelter closed
this cut producer stocks and contributed to closer supply demand balance within the market for many years depressed by surplus production and regular supplier to the world market
mexican supplies which have sometimes swelled lme stocks have been normal but are finding ready buyers traders said
on the demand side winter battery manufacture has held up quite well and some buying of lead sheet has been reported in the soviet lead buying notably absent in europe in the first two months of the year was resumed when large buying order was filled by merchants in march
merchant demand has fuelled the rise in lme lead prices this week and has seen cash metal move above stg and establish premium of around stg over three months delivery
specific demand has been directed towards metal in gothenburg and trieste warehouses
gothenburg material is often target for merchants shipping to the ussr traders said
on stocks the popular lme continental warehouses antwerp and rotterdam have little more than tonnes of lead each and this is believed to be in strong hands
out of total tonnes in lme stocks the lowest level since june just over half is in
warehouses which are not popular with merchants putting together shipments
but even stocks have dropped around tonnes since the start of the year
traders said this is partly due to secondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed supplies affected by environmental controls which put restrictions on the transport of used batteries
labour negotiations in north america will play an important part in determining the direction of prices with contracts expiring end april at cominco trail and kimberley mine smelter and at doe run herculaneum mo smelter
noranda new brunswick mine smelter also has contract expiry in july which may cause some nervousness in view of strikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months
traders said lme three months delivery already attracting speculative buying could rise to stg on current firmness while nearby tightness could widen the cash premium to from four
three months was quoted at stg at midsession

lawson says some countries could cut rates nigel lawson britain chancellor of the exchequer said some countries may need to cut interest rates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability
speaking to journalists one day after the group of seven countries reaffirmed goals set in paris six weeks ago he said central banks would continue to intervene as and when necessary
he said the countries were concerned that japan do more to stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined by japanese finance minister kiichi miyazawa yesterday
lawson said he was still worried about the risk of simultaneous recession in the united states japan and west germany though less so than when he gave his march budget speech to the british parliament
if anything little bit less concerned but there is still risk he said
asked if the united states should consider increasing interest rates to support the dollar he said if there is need for changes in relative interest rates it doesn need to be rise in interest rates in the united states
lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday meetings at the slow progress the united states had made in reducing its budget deficit
we believe there will be some worthwhile progress in reducing the deficit this year
the important thing is that it continue year after year lawson said
the february louvre accord called for efforts to stabilize currencies at then current exchange rates
in the six weeks that followed the japanese yen continued to rise against the dollar despite massive central bank intervention
asked whether this intervention was sign of weakness in the louvre accord he said don think so
if there had been no intervention you would have called that sign of weakness
although intervention could be cause of inflation lawson said the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode but one has to be vigilant
he said yesterday statement which affirmed that current levels of exchange rates were appropriate had been carefully worded
we know what we mean and we all mean the same thing he said
lawson said financial markets seem to believe that japanese measures outlined in the louvre accord were the source of weakness for that agreement
therefore the countries welcomed miyazawa presentation of plans for supplemental budget to stimulate domestic demand
they particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate increase in public works spending but lawson said the package also involved second stage to increase expenditures during the second half of this year

talking point steel companies steel stocks which have had healthy runup recently still present some short term investment opportunities according to some steel analysts
but others say the upturn based on strong orders and firm prices this spring has been strictly seasonal and will end soon
they recommend taking profits
it that time of year
this is strictly seasonal said charles bradford of merrill lynch and co orders will be strong for about two months and there are signs that some order rates are starting to dive already
but dean witter reynolds inc analyst clarence morrison sees some short term potential in the group which includes usx corp lt bethlehem steel corp lt bs armco inc lt as and inland steel industries inc lt iad
there is still some attractiveness to steels over the short to intermediate term based on improved order rates and rising prices morrison said
he only recommends one stock however inland which is modernizing steelmaking operations to make them more efficient
despite his bearishness merrill bradford continues to recommend armco which he sees as major turnaround
armco steelmaking operations are profitable the balance sheet has been improved and its oilfield equipment business has been slimmed and put in joint venture with usx bradford noted
it not high quality investment situation yet but they ve come long way he said
we think the stock will do moderately better than the market he said
armco shares trading off at today could go to and possibly as high as he said
bradford sees armco earning to cts share in before special gains from recouped investment tax credits against losses last year
armco earnings could be significantly higher he said
bradford is recommending sale of usx shares
we had buy on it below but when it gets to let somebody else have it he said

canada trade rise seen as start of recovery canada trade picture has brightened considerably underscoring economists predictions the sector would post long awaited recovery this year
the federal government reported today that the monthly surplus soared to billion canadian dlrs in february double january mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher than february mln dlr tally
hopefully it the beginning of trend said richardson greenshields of canada ltd economist susan clark in toronto
economists generally don expect such large gains over the next months but are looking for an upward trend throughout the year
we thought the trade balance would improve over the year and it certainly looks as if this morning figure is indicative of that commented economist james donegan at the toronto securities firm of midland doherty ltd statistics canada reported the surplus was driven by pct gain in automobile product exports to record billion dls in the month
recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value of exports up by pct in february the agency said in its monthly report
total exports expanded to billion dlrs from billion dlrs in february while imports slipped to billion dlrs from billion dlrs
economists have predicted the trade surplus would end up three to five billion dlrs higher than last year dismal billion dlr total

money market analysts said the positive trade news touched off modest rally in the canadian dollar which rose to cts on north american markets early this morning after closing at cts wednesday
the currency was hovering around cts in early afternoon trading
economists have been banking on an improved trade performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish canadian economy
they say the country consumers who have been spending at torrid pace in recent years will sharply curtail outlays this year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into the country
meanwhile demand for canadian exports in the united states by far the country largest market is expected to be strong as result of projected rise in american consumer spending and the relatively low value of the canadian currency
we maintain what going to drive canada export performance is income growth in the said midland donegan
but at the bank of nova scotia deputy chief economist warren jestin was less optimistic about the outlook and said it could be mistake to read too much into february trade upturn
jestin said given the fact the economy is showing signs of weakening particularly car sales it would indicate that part of the strength in canada trade figures is probably transitory

oil dependency seen rising to record level the united states dependency on foreign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid according to john lichtblau president of petroleum industry research associates
lichtblau speaking at an alternative energy conference here said the may depend on foreign suppliers for as much as pct of its oil by surpasssing the previous high level of pct in
the long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is inevitable lichtblau said
as much as pct of oil imports in could come from opec nations he said
lichtblau said the depended on foreign suppliers for pct of its oil in and predicted that would increase to pct by
however the rate of this growth can be affected positively or negatively through government action or inaction lichtblau said
he said that one of the government negative actions is the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash flow for oil exploration
lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices
an international floor price adopted by all or most industrial countries would clearly be much more effective measure and would be much less distortive for the than if we imposed it alone lichtblau said
development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic fuels as well as increased development in alaska could lessen dependency on foreign oil lichtblau said
potential for alternative supplies could limit the willingness of opec nations to raise oil prices he said
lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer tax abatements for oil drilling to fill the strategic petroleum reserve at faster rate and to develop pilot plans for alternative energy

treasury baker says system needs stability treasury secretary james baker said the floating exchange rate system has not been as effective as had been hoped in promoting stability and preventing imbalances from emerging in the global economy
in remarks before the afternoon session of the international monetary fund interim committee baker said he was not suggesting that the system should be abandoned
but do suggest he said that we need something to give it more stability and to keep it headed in the right direction when the wind shifts
he said that indicators can serve as kind of compass but added that structural indicators can help focus attention on some policies
baker however said the imf needs to move beyond macroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators that can help focus attention on some of the policies of specific relevance to the imbalances we face today
the treasury secretary said that indicators should be given more prominent role in the annual economic reviews article iv consultations that the fund performs
baker also told the policy making group that it was time for the imf to adopt earlier recommendations making imf surveillance more relevant to national policymakers and the public
in particular we urge increased publicity for imf appraisals developed in article iv consultations the use of follow up reports on country actions to implement imf recommendations and greater use of special consultation procedures he said
baker emphasized that indicators were device for moving beyond rhetoric to action
he said they provide more structure to the system and induce more discipline and peer pressure into the process of policy coordination
he said the fund procedures for surveillance need to be reviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators
this should be matter of priority for the executive board he said
baker also urged the fund to develop alternative medium term economic scenarios for countries that can help us focus even more clearly on the most important imbalances by identifying options for addressing them and analyzing the implications of these options
he said also that further work should be done on finding paths that lead toward possible medium term objectives
if we are to take effective remedial action when there are significant deviations from an intended course then we must have more definitive ways of indentifying the right course for key variables he said

dollar losses propel broad commodity gains commodities from gold to grains to cotton posted solid gains in flurry of buying today as losses in the dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears of inflation and economic instability
gains were most pronounced on the commodity exchange in new york where gold jumped dlrs and closed at dlrs troy ounce and silver cents to dlrs troy ounce
key factor behind the advance was anticipation that inflation will be the only way for the major industrial nations to halt the slide in the value of the dollar said steve chronowitz director of commodity research with smith barney harris upham and co in new york
the dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials from the seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed their commitment to support its value and despite reports of intervention by the federal reserve bank traders said
traders said it appears that the industrial nations known as the group of seven lack the ability to change the long term direction of the currency markets
maybe they have some ideas or plans said chronowitz
if they do it not evident
it looks like there no cure but to let the free market take values to where they should be
one way or another we will force our major trading partners to stimulate their economies as measure to correct the mounting trade deficit chronowitz said
think the markets believe and have believed for long time that the only recourse is to reflate at some point
it going to be long and tedious process but that what happening he said
the falling value of the dollar makes commodities cheaper for foreign buyers stimulating demand
at the same time traders who are holding stocks and bonds saw the value of their investments falling and many are turning to commodities such as precious metals as hedge said marty mcneill metals analyst in new york with the trading house of dominick and dominick
the reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughout the commodities markets as grains livestock and cotton posted broad gains
traders at the chicago board of trade said attention in the grain markets has shifted from concern about burdensome supplies to the outlook that lower dollar will stimulate export demand
after the close of trading the agriculture department raised its estimate for grain imports by the soviet union by two mln tonnes from the month earlier report
live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on the chicago mercantile exchange while live cattle were moderately higher
analysts said several factors boosted hog prices
they said hogs haven been making the weight gains that are normal at this time of year and farmers have been too busy with field work to market animals

however the dean witter economist noted that the latest two week period included quarter end when seasonal demand often pushes up borrrowings
some might argue that the fed was firming policy but it looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions late in the statement period and didn quite make it said ward mccarthy of merrill lynch capital markets
fed spokesman told press press conference today that the fed had no large net one day miss of two billion dlrs or more in its reserve projections in the week ended wednesday
still mccarthy said it may have had cumulative miss in its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed
the fed took no market reserve management action last thursday and friday the first two days of the week
it added temporary reserves indirectly on monday via two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves directly via system repurchases on tuesday and wednesday
based on fed data out today economists calculated that the two day system repurchase agreements the fed arrranged on tuesday totaled around billion dlrs
they put wednesday overnight system repos at approximately billion dlrs
it is quite clear that the fed is not firming policy at this time said larry leuzzi of warburg and co inc
citing the view shared by the other two economists leuzzi said the fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak economies in the united states and abroad and add to the financial stress of developing countries and their lenders
those who believe the fed tightened policy in the latest statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar tumbled said mccarthy of merrill lynch
he said the dollar staged precipitous drop as new statement period began today on disappointment yesterday washington meetings of international monetary officials failed to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid
in fact currency dealers said there was nothing in wednesday communique to alter the prevailing view that the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade imbalance between the united states and japan
the economists generally agreed that the fed is aiming for steady policy now that should correspond to weekly average fed funds rate between six and pct
this is about where the rate has been since early november
not so sure that the fed is engineering tighter policy to help the dollar as some suspect said sullivan of dean witter
if it is however he said that fed probably has just nudged up its funds rate goal to around to pct from six to pct previously

markets offer glimpse of volcker nightmare today turmoil in the financial markets with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar wake is evidence of major shift in investor psychology that is likely to spell more turbulence ahead economists said
for two years the markets had hailed the dollar decline as the cure all for the trade deficit
interest rates fell sharply and wall street became one way street up
but that confidence is now cracking as the financial markets suddenly believe fed chairman paul volcker often repeated warnings about the risks of dollar collapse
volcker been saying for long time that dollar freefall would be extremely dangerous now he got it said david jones economist at aubrey lanston and co inc
the dollar fell below yen today for the first time in years as the group of seven finance ministers in washington failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances short of further depreciation of the dollar
bonds suffered their biggest one day drop in months amid worries that the dollar slide will rekindle inflation scare away foreign investors and force the fed to tighten credit
the inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than dlrs to high of dlrs an ounce while the spike in interest rates pulled the dow jones industrial average down by points to
norman robertson mellon bank chief economist called the markets instability frightening
he believes economic fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that once you start the ball rolling it difficult to stop
there stark possibility that you could get destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates and drives us into recession
the markets are in panic
stephen marris of the institute for international economics in washington has been warning for long time that the controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of marks and yen in february could turn into nightmare
we re still more or less on track for hard landing
but the agony may be fairly drawn out marris told reuters
marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this year but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it would take very little to touch off what he calls the second phase of the hard landing whereby loss of confidence in the dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to recession
the stock market reaction today and its sharp drop on march shows how the loss of confidence could come about
the fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with historical experience which teaches that domestic markets are not affected until currency is in the final stages of its decline marris said
he has forecast drop to about yen
marris felt that major impetus for the dollar latest weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling below yen the floor that the market believes was set as part of the paris agreement in february
robertson at mellon by contrast said the loss of confidence was triggered last week when washington announced plans to slap mln dlrs of tariffs on japanese electronic imports raising the specter of debilitating trade war
many economists believe that long run stability will not return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is addressed excessive consumption in the reflected in the massive budget deficit
but in the short term given the failure of the and of central bank intervention some feel that the fed will have no choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar
the only thing that will stop the dollar falling is substantial increase in the discount rate and corresponding cut abroad at least by japan said lanston jones
marris expects the fed to act quickly to raise interest rates even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for american farmers latin american governments and others
but robert giordano chief economist at goldman sachs and co scoffed at the notion
it ridiculous to think the federal reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak against just one currency
this is yen strength not dollar weakness he said
giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being made toward reducing the budget deficit
we re going to have one of the biggest reductions in the budget deficit relative to gnp in history this year and nobody cares he said noting that only the deficit cut in will have been greater
he said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year
but for now market psychology has changed so abruptly that further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out
put on your helmets giordano said

japan has no plans to cut discount rate bank of japan sources said the bank has no plans to cut its discount rate
they told reporters that there was no pressure on japan during the group of seven meeting here yesterday to lower its discount rate
they added that they themselves do not feel any need for cut at all
chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson told reporters earlier today that some countries those with strong currencies might have to cut interest rates
the bank of japan sources also said that it was too soon to call the pact failure
the central bank sources were commenting on the dollar renewed tumble in new york and tokyo which was sparked by remarks by treasury secretary james baker that the dollar fall had been orderly
they said the market must have misinterpreted baker comments because he was referring to the dollar fall since the plaza agreement in september over long time span not the currency recent movements
they added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seize on anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way or the other
the bank of japan sources said the is putting more weight on the dollar yen rate in terms of judging market stability than on other currencies
throughout the meeting japan pointed to the dangers that would arise from further dollar fall because it would reduce the flow of japanese capital to the hurting the and world economies they said
in february and in march of this year japanese investors reduced their purchases of treasury bonds the sources said
each country in the britain canada france italy japan the and west germany has different view about currency stability the bank of japan sources said
this is because the overall foreign exchange market is triangle of dollar yen european currencies yen and dollar european currencies
at the time of the louvre agreement european countries did not want the yen to weaken against their currencies so they did not object to the yen strengthening they said

smuggling blamed for closure of haitian sugar firm sugar mill which was this nation second largest employer closed its doors yesterday saying it had been run out of business by sugar smuggled from miami and the neighbouring dominican republic
the closure of the haitian american sugar company hasco will idle employees and affect as many as to small sugar cane planters in regions around the capital the company said
because of unprecedented and ever growing smuggling hasco regrets
it cannot continue to accept delivery of sugar cane after april the mill warned planters earlier this week
since president jean claude duvalier fled haiti fourteen months ago widescale smuggling of basic goods such as cooking oil flour rice sugar and canned milk has lowered consumer prices but bankrupted several local manufacturers throwing hundreds of thousands of haitians out of work
at the hasco compound where grim faced workers lined up to receive their last pay spokesman georges rigaud showed warehouse stocked with an estimated unsold pound kg bags of sugar
we are closing because of our huge stock of unsold sugar
we have no money left to continue operations rigaud said
he said the company owed mln dlrs and had borrowed an additional mln dlrs in order to pay off workers
rigaud blamed the mill problems on an order by duvalier two years ago forbidding hasco from refining sugar
he said the government then began importing refined sugar at world market prices and reselling it at huge profit and the provisional military civilian government that replaced duvalier last year continued the policy
but now with all the smuggling even the state can compete with smuggled dominican refined sugar rigaud said
hasco workers earned dlrs daily considerably above the usual minimum wage of three dlrs
it is generally estimated that every employed haitian supports at least six people
rigaud said hasco closing at minimum would affect to people
laid off workers were bitter about the closure

taiwan announces new round of import tariff cuts taiwan announced plans for another round of import tariff cuts on foreign goods shortly before trade talks with washington which officials described as move to help balance trade with the united states
wang der hwa deputy director of the finance ministry customs administration department told reporters the list of products included items asked by washington
the move is part of our government efforts to encourage imports from our trading partners particularly from the united states he said
he said the ministry sent proposal today to the cabinet that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics bicycles apples radios garments soybeans and television sets be cut by between five and pct
the cabinet was expected to give its approval next thursday and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting on april he added
taiwan introduced sweeping tariff cut on some foreign products last january aimed at helping reduce its growing trade surplus with the united states the island largest trading partner
washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and pressed for more reductions as way of cutting its huge trade deficit with taipei
washington deficit with taipei rose to record billion dlrs last year from billion in
it widened to billion in the first quarter of from billion year earlier taiwan official figures show
today announcement came before departure later today of member taiwan delegation for washington for series of trade talks with officials
the delegation leader vincent siew told reporters last night he was leaving with heavy heart meaning that he would face tough talks in washington because of rising protectionist sentiments in the congress
taiwan trade surplus with washington was the third largest after japan and canada

british minister says he warned tokyo of sanctions british minister said he had given the japanese government clear warning of sanctions against japanese companies if tokyo did not allow more access to its internal markets and it was clearly understood
corporate affairs minister michael howard said on his return from visit to japan he thought the japanese were beginning to appreciate the need to be fair and open about access to their own markets
at an airport news conference howard denied opposition charges that his trip had been failure because he had returned empty handed
did what set out to do
was sent to deliver clear message to the japanese government and delivered it very clearly and it has been clearly understood
howard said that under the financial services act the govenment had considerable flexibility in taking sanctions against japanese companies and finance houses operating in britain
it is not simply question of withdrawing or refusing operating licences
we can ban firms from certain countries from carrying out certain kinds of business while allowing them to carry out other kinds
hope we don have to use these powers but made it clear in japan that if our timetable isn met we shall use them
he said it would be unfortunate if britain and japan became involved in tit for tat exchange adding that japan gained more than anyone else from an open trading relationship
think they are beginning to appreciate that if this relationship is to continue it is very important for them to be fair and open about access to their own markets
on the question of the british firm cable and wireless plc lt cawl which is trying to win significant share of telecommunications contracts in japan howard said he had told the japanese this was being widely regarded as test case
he said there were signs of movement on the case
cable and wireless was due to take part in talks in japan next tuesday he said
earlier this week british prime minister margaret thatcher said britain could not go it alone on sanctions against japan but would have to coordinate action with its european community partners
community sources said after meeting of trade officials yesterday that the group might impose steep new tariffs on range of japanese goods to prevent diversion from united states markets if washington imposes trade sanctions against tokyo as it has threatened

uganda pulls out of coffee market trade sources uganda coffee marketing board cmb has stopped offering coffee on the international market because it is unhappy with current prices coffee trade sources said
the board suspended offerings last week but because of its urgent need for cash it was not immediately clear how long it could sustain the sources added
hundreds of ugandan coffee farmers and processors have been waiting several months for payment from the cmb which has had trouble finding enough railway wagons to move the coffee to the kenyan port of mombasa
foreign banks have contributed to the cash crisis by holding up remittance of uganda hard currency earnings from coffee exports the government newspaper new vision said
the banks are holding up to seven mln dlrs in coffee money and president yoweri museveni is thinking of imposing penalty for such delays it added
banking sources said third factor in the crisis was that commercial banks have lent the board only billion shillings the equivalent of mln dlrs for crop finance in the current coffee year while the government had asked for billion
the cmb has kg bags of coffee about pct of annual production stockpiled in kampala awaiting shipment
the crop accounts for over pct of uganda export earnings and the recent slide in prices to four year lows is likely to more than offset an expected increase in production
cmb officials have forecast that because the government has restored law and order in important growing areas uganda will produce over three mln bags of coffee in the year ending september about pct more than in

australian government must cut spending anz says the government must announce harsh cuts in spending in its may economic statement if it is to give an adequate response to australia economic problems the anz banking group ltd lt anza said
cuts of two billion dlrs would be insufficient against the backdrop of billion dlr government deficit and billion dlr current account deficit it said in its monthly business indicators publication
for the past two years the government has struggled with an economic reality that demands measures beyond those which it sees as politically practicable it said
the political climate meant there would be continued over reliance on monetary policy to hold the exchange rate and maintain confidence in economic management anz said
the cost of this approach is that the much needed revival of business investment will be further postponed it said
the economy was now on modest growth upswing boosted by export and import replacement industries which had created false suggestion that the worst adjustments to the balance of payments crisis were past
unfortunately successful adjustment to australia deep seated economic problems remains long term process it said
in its economic forecasts anz said it expected moderate overall economic growth with gross domestic product gdp rising pct this year and pct in
the current account deficit would narrow to five pct of gdp this year and pct in and net foreign debt would grow strongly from billion at the end of to billion at end and billion year later
inflation would fall to pct in and pct in from pct in and further falls in real wages were expected anz said

should texaco fail to place the bond pennzoil could begin to attach its assets to secure the judgment
last monday the supreme court overturned decision to cut texaco bond to one billion dlrs and sent the issue back to the texas courts
analysts said the bankruptcy filing effectively froze all texaco obligations while it continued to appeal the merits of the pennzoil lawsuit
attempts last week to win compromise on both the bond issue and the larger dispute failed james kinnear texaco president and chief executive officer told reporters
kinnear said pennzoil disclosure in court papers on friday that it wanted to extend the bond issue hearing until the end of april pushed texaco further towards chapter
pennzoil had asked texaco to post billion dlr cash bond and to reduce its dividend to not more than pct of earnings
pennzoil also wanted assurances that texaco would not sell any assets kinnear said
texaco offered to put up one billion dlrs in letter of credit and agreed not to let the value of its assets fall under billion dlrs he added

he declined to reveal the amount of the proposal citing confidentiality agreement between the two companies
texaco told us they would get back to us but instead they chose to go to bankruptcy court jamail said
attorneys for pennzoil said they believed the company would prevail in court appeals adding that texaco assets were ample ultimately to pay the pennzoil judgment in full

offer for dome may short circuit its debt talks billion dlr offer for dome petroleum ltd lt dmp mo by transcanada pipelines ltd lt trp to may short circuit dome restructuring plan and open the door for more takeover bids oil analysts said
dome is trying to get approval for plan to refinance debt of more than billion dlrs by july when an interim debt plan that allowed the canadian oil and gas firm to defer substantial payments to creditors will expire
analysts said transcanada bid signals dome debtholders that an alternative exists to dome debt plan
dome announced its plan to major creditors as well as public noteholders in march after several months of delicate negotiations
transcanada proposal amounts to quasi debt restructuring oil analyst doug gowland of brown baldwin nisker ltd said from toronto
calgary based dome restructuring plan would allow creditors to convert debt to common shares under formula yet to be negotiated
payments on remaining debt would be linked to cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt
the weakness of the whole debt refinancing proposal is that even with approval of creditors there is no assurance that dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations said wilf gobert an oil analyst for peters and co ltd in calgary
transcanada announcement came as surprise since dome was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed refinancing packages gobert said
the transcanada proposal could open the bidding for dome since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders to agree to restructuring he added
would think that the debtholders would want to entertain any and all offers for dome gobert said
dome spokesman david annesley said in new york that transcanada announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix the bidding price for dome and an effort to preclude other possible buyers from making an offer
by drawing attention to us in our discussions it means that others may be little reluctant to come forward he said
dome does not consider transcanada proposal formal offer because the pipeline utility announcement breached confidential agreement between the two companies he said
dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions with transcanada in order to pursue talks with other unidentified parties
however dome said its management and financial advisers would evaluate all proposals including transcanada
gowland said transcanada offer is probably fair price for the company mln acres of oil and gas land holdings
however he said not enough financial details are known about dome debt restructuring to compare the value of transcanada proposed offer

trade issues straining ec patience with japan member states of the european community are starting to run out of patience with japan which they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open its market to imports but as often made only minor moves
diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by ec countries bear witness to new disillusionment with the willingness or at least the ability of the japanese government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the ec
however they said an all out trade war may be far off as ec states know they would suffer almost as much as japan
senior ec diplomats gave generally favourable reaction to an ec executive commission proposal under which the ec could raise tariffs on range of japanese products if the
carries out threat to make similar move on april
the ec tariffs which would involve renouncing obligations entered into with the world trade body gatt would be designed to stop diversion of exports to the ec market from that of the
the diplomats were meeting as tokyo announced that the ec trade deficit with japan reached record billion dlrs in march up from billion in february
in japanese exports to the ec totalled billion dlrs up pct from while ec exports to japan fell one pct to billion dlrs
in paris trade minister michel noir said france has decided to give japan taste of its own medicine
burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozen coquilles st jacques will be restricted by strict application of french quality standards something ec states say often happens to their own exports entering japan
britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of japanese banks and insurance companies to operate in the city of london because the british cable and wireless company lost out in competition for japanese telecommucations contract
however british officials in london have said that the government may have gone too far in implying that it would take immediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened
by contrast west germany with the ec most successful economy has never threatened tokyo with sanctions preferring to rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its own industries to surmount obstacles to export to japan
the ec commission itself has switched its tactics in recent years substituting general calls for action by japan to open its market with specific demands for moves in key areas
at present it is for instance pressuring japan to end allegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines and spirits to ensure ec companies have chance to win contracts for the building of new international airport and to simplify certification and safety checks on imported cars
ec officials say these tactics yield some benefits but often the japanese announce modifications of their non tariff barriers which open the door to imports by only token amount
they stress however that any action must be taken by the ec as whole to stop beggar my neighbour action
one of the problems britain could face if it were to withdraw licences for japanese banks would be that the bankers would be welcomed with open arms in frankfurt or amsterdam they point out

awb chairman urges farmers not to cut plantings australia could lose valuable wheat markets through lack of availability if plantings for the coming season are significantly reduced australian wheat board awb chairman clinton condon said
if predictions of pct decrease in plantings prove true australia may not be able to supply wheat to some of its valuable markets he said in statement
condon did not say who had made the predictions but an awb spokesman said there was general industry feeling that farmers hard hit by low prices and rising costs could cut back plantings sharply
wheat sowing normally begins in may
however condon said he did not believe plantings would be cut by as much as pct although he realised many farmers were facing enormous financial pressures
he said the awb expects the area sown to be about mln hectares down from mln in when the crop was about mln tonnes
final crop estimates for and planting intentions for are not yet available
if the awb is unable because of short term cut in plantings to meet the needs of the markets it has developed with much time and effort it may have great difficulty selling wheat to those markets in the future condon said
markets which rely on steady supply of australian wheat understand decrease in production due to drought but they will have difficulty understanding deliberate decision to decrease production condon said
if australia wants wheat to continue as major export income earner governments and government authorities will need to closely examine ways of contributing to the continuing viability of the wheat industry he added
australia leading wheat markets include china egypt iran iraq the soviet union and japan

dutch feed compounder starts case against ec levy major animal feed producer cehave nv veghel chv has begun legal proceedings against the application of the european community grain co responsibility levy with the full backing of the dutch animal grain and feed trade association het comite association chief executive peter pex told reuters
oral proceedings were held in the hague on friday and the court said it would give its verdict within six weeks
however that is the normal wording and we expect the hague court to refer questions on the interpretation and application of the levy to the european court of justice in luxembourg pex added
het comite claims the way the levy is applied does not take account of currency cross rates of exchange and can mean compounder in one country being asked to pay higher levy in its own national currency than it received down the chain from the original producer of the grain
we would like the business administration court in the hague to ask the luxembourg court of justice not only whether the dutch grain commodity board the levy collection agency has interpreted the levy regulations correctly but also whether the regulations themselves may contravene european law pex said
it is only with great regret that we have taken this route but we have had no political help and therefore have no option even though it could take years pex added
het comite asked chv to act as test case against the grain levy because the bill the company received from the commodity board included grain from wide variety of origins and was therefore considered to be the best general basis for legal challenge to the levy pex noted
het comite actions will run in tandem with questions on the levy already posed to the luxembourg court in case brought by the association of european animal feed manufacturers fefac

institutes divided on outlook for german economy the five leading west german economic research institutes have failed to agree about how strongly the domestic economy will expand this year but revised down forecasts contained in report published six months ago
the three research groups of kiel hamburg and essen predicted in the institutes joint spring report that gross national product gnp would rise by two pct in compared with pct in
the five institutes had jointly forecast three pct growth in october last year
taking dissenting view the diw institute of west berlin and munich ifo institute predicted only one pct growth
the joint report said that the estimates of economic development made by the diw and ifo were markedly less favourable than those of the other three
the diw and ifo forecast the economy would pick up after slow start to the year
in the second half of there will however only be weak upward movement they said
the two institutes said external economic factors which were currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would dominate the economic environment throughout the year
they saw exports falling by real pct in and predicted no marked improvement in the course of the year
the other three institutes however wrote the decline in demand and production seen in the winter months does not indicate the beginning of cyclical downswing
they said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate uncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans
but they expected that many investments had not been cancelled but only put off
it can be presumed that the braking actions on the economy will diminish markedly this year
they added the domestic prerequisites for continuation of the economic uptrend are still favourable
these three institutes said diminishing external burdens combined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in demand and production could be expected by the spring
however this projection was clouded by risks including the further development of the mark against the dollar
contrary to the diw and ifo the three institutes said that while exports would continue to be the weak point of the economy in there is good reason to believe that exports will soon bottom out and that slight rise will emerge during the course of the year
they predicted an overall pct fall in exports in the same as in
the three more positive institutes saw private consumption rising by four pct in compared with pct in while diw and ifo predicted three pct increase
they saw the climate for equipment investment improving but predicted only rise of four pct in against pct in
ifo and diw saw these investments rising by only two pct
all the institutes predicted only slight decline in unemployment
the kiel hamburg and essen institutes said the jobless total would average mln in compared with mln in and predicted rise in the number of people in work of about
these three institutes said new jobs would be created mainly in the private services sector and also by the state in the context of job creation measures
the construction industry was likely to engage new workers for the first time since but they predicted either no rise in employment in the manufactured goods industry or only slight expansion
the diw and ifo said rises in employment would occur only in the tertiary sector while the number employed in the manufacturing industry will decline
the diw and ifo said unemployment would only decline to mln in from mln in
they saw the current account surplus falling in to billion marks from billion in
the other three saw current account surplus in of at least billion marks and predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around billion marks from billion in
the institutes agreed that consumer prices would start to rise in after they declined in and all five predicted an average increase over the year of pct

west german institutes call for early tax cuts the five leading west german economic research institutes said the government should do more to stimulate economic growth and called for early introduction of tax cuts planned for
in their joint spring report the institutes were divided about growth forecasts with three predicting two pct expansion and the other two only one pct growth
gross national product grew pct last year
but the report said all the institutes believed that more must be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additional jobs can be created
the institutes said any step which improved basic economic conditions should be taken as quickly as possible
from this point of view the tax reform planned for should be brought forward
the government plans gross tax reductions of billion marks as part of the major tax reform
the net tax relief from the tax reform will amount to billion marks
however the institutes criticised the government not only for the timing of the reform but also because the question of its financing had been left open
the government has not specified how the remaining billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies
the institutes said this lack of clarity from bonn had caused uncertainty among companies and households as to what exactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged quick decision from the government
they also said the government should reduce tax preferences which would simplify the fiscal system urged restriction of state spending and called for no increase in value added tax
the institutes also criticised bonn for increasing subsidies at time further reductions had been pledged
they referred specifically to doubling of special writedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in package of tax adjustments planned for and described this as an increase in subsidies
the institutes said total subsidies including tax preferences had reached billion marks in and risen further since then
given the scope of these subsidies it should be possible despite major political difficulties to finance the tax reform by cutting state handouts
the institutes said that if the government raised value added tax or other indirect taxes large portion of the positive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost
the report also noted that the government was progressing only slowly with its plans to privatise state companies and said more deregulation was needed
the government had to aim for more competition it said

currency moves may be hurting world trade japanese trade figures are seriously challenging the entrenched view of policy makers of the group of seven industrialised nations that relative currency rates are the key to smoothing world trade problems
senior japanese and european officials in tokyo say they are at loss to fully explain the data for if currencies are the key they ask why then are are exports to japan shrinking

so worst of all what if volcker is correct

what do know is that community exporters are making hell of an effort in this market
if you make an effort there is money to be made in japan he added
but officials and businessmen are convinced low exports to japan are japan fault
they cite restrictive trade practices protected japanese trade sectors such as agriculture and non tariff barriers such as unreasonable checking and customs procedures for car imports
publicly japanese officials remain conciliatory in the face of what they see as
in private they blame industry for being uncompetitive
we see it that way but we don like to seem arrogant said senior official who declined to be named
we like to refrain from accusing them of not making enough effort
industrialists such as eishiro saito chairman of the keidanren business group and sony corp chairman akio morita repeatedly accuse foreign firms of not making enough effort to understand japan markets and some foreigners agree
the real issue is the inability of major sectors of american and european industry to compete not only internationally but even in their home markets peter huggler president of interallianz bank zurich told recent conference in switzerland

producer prices seen moved by technicalities producer price data for march were roughly as expected after taking into account technical factors which affected the year on year outcome economic analysts said
the figures showed pct provisional non seasonally adjusted rise in output prices in march unchanged from february and close to the average for the last six months
the year on year rise was put at pct down from pct in february
but chris tinker economist at brokerage house phillips and drew said the drop in the year on year rate mainly reflected rise in excise duties which affected the index in march last year
he cautioned that it was dangerous to read too much into the monthly figure adding that rise of only pct in april would take the year on year rise back above pct
analysts also noted that drop in manufacturers input prices was almost entirely due to anticipated seasonal factors such as fall in industrial electricity costs
duncan squire of lloyds merchant bank said the figures were slightly disappointing in that the strengthening of sterling had not yet reduced input prices as much as expected
both he and tinker said this factor should help keep input costs down over the next few months although tinker added that last year fall in oil prices is now about to drop out of the year on year comparisons and is likely to lead to return to rises in the index rather than falls
bangemann rejects call for early tax cuts west german economics minister martin bangemann indirectly rejected call from the country leading economic research institutes for early introduction of major tax reform involving gross tax cuts of billion marks
in statement reacting to the five institutes joint spring report bangemann said that as far as the call for bringing forward the tax reform was concerned the government points out that the positive effects for growth of its policy of consolidation cutting the budget deficit must not be allowed to be endangered
bangemann also recalled that the scope of tax cuts planned for had already been increased
three institutes predicted two pct economic growth in with exports falling by pct
the other two saw only one pct growth and said exports would fall pct
bangemann said the government agreeing with the majority sees no reason for the extraordinarily pessimistic estimate for exports expressed by the minority
he said there was reason to believe that export demand would start to rise in the course of the year partly because of further increase in world trade

seems worried markets ignore coordination top officials of leading industrial nations appear deeply worried that financial markets have ignored their efforts to coordinate policies which they believe they strengthened in talks last week
monetary sources said officials were exasperated that the markets which drove the dollar rapidly lower and severely disrupted bond and stock markets too did not take heed of the policy commitments of the group of seven the united states japan west germany france britain italy and canada
treasury secretary james baker went out of his way to reassure markets of his commitment to stable dollar with statement and french finance minister edouard balladur underscored that by saying don believe at all that the americans want weaker dollar
west german finance minister gerhard stoltenberg said the dollar latest rapid descent involves the risk now already tangible threat of new strong surge of inflation leading to renewed rise in interest rates
but there were signs too that while policymakers feared the market uproar they seemed to accept there was little they could do until the economic picture changed and currencies settled into stable pattern as result
nor did there seem to be any enthusiasm at last week semi annual meetings of the imf and the world bank for higher interest rates as the best way to curb the dollar rapid descent
that distaste stems in part from fears of recession
outgoing deputy treasury secretary richard darman told television interviewers he did not think policy of driving the dollar down would solve the trade deficit
it would slow growth in germany and japan which would adversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it would drive interest rates up here which would throw us if not into recession into slower growth he said
asked if higher interest rates would stabilize the dollar balladur said when currency is maintained artificially high by artificially high interest rates it is not healthy
and resorting to higher interest rates could lead to recession he said
acknowledging the dollar latest slide was now fact of life balladur said there may be adjustments of course in one or other currencies this is not fixed rate system
but federal reserve board chairman paul volcker said he might rein in credit if the dollar slide deepens
monetary sources also said washington wanted it understood by markets the seven commitments were genuine
the united states and the six major industrial countries are fully committed to implementing our undertakings in these agreements baker told the meetings
darman said baker had been misinterpreted by markets which wrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted further decline in the dollar
baker darman said was committed to stabilizing currencies at current levels
last week statement from the seven reaffirmed february agreement in paris in which the reagan administration agreed to reach budget deficit compromise with congress and to fight protectionism
west germany and japan meanwhile agreed to stimulate domestic demand and lead global upturn
ministers believed the paris pact was bolstered by japan promise of billion dlr supplementary budget
the sources said they believed baker saw it as major action
but the seven seem to accept their commitment to stable currencies applied to today exchange rates and not those at the time of the paris agreement when the dollar stood higher
the paris accord said currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals given the policy commitments summarized in this statement
now they accept the dollar lower level especially against the yen as hard reality that is nonetheless consistent with the agreement
the ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals last week statement read
monetary sources said policymakers understood markets were focusing on instability created by the gap between the trade deficit and the surpluses of west germany and japan rather than prospective policy changes
european monetary sources said bonn was still unconvinced that washington meant business with its commitment to cut the budget deficit
institutes see no west german recession the five leading west german economic research institutes which have revised down their forecasts for growth do not predict recession in west germany their spokesman hans juergen schmahl said
the institutes were divided in their spring report on forecasts for with three predicting two pct growth and two seeing only one pct expansion
growth was pct in
schmahl presenting the report at news conference said none of the institutes reckons with recession or with the beginning of recession
he added however that exports remained the weak point of the economy
schmahl also said west germany would have to expect further encroachments of foreign goods onto its markets
arthur krumper of munich ifo institute which with the diw of west berlin had presented the more pessimistic view of the economy said the braking effects on the economy produced by external factors will remain considerable for most of the year

offer for dome may short circuit its debt talks billion dlr offer for dome petroleum ltd lt dmp mo by transcanada pipelines ltd lt trp to may short circuit dome restructuring plan and open the door for more takeover bids oil analysts said
dome is trying to get approval for plan to refinance debt of more than billion dlrs by july when an interim debt plan that allowed the canadian oil and gas firm to defer substantial payments to creditors will expire
analysts said transcanada bid signals dome debtholders that an alternative exists to dome debt plan
dome announced its plan to major creditors as well as public noteholders in march after several months of delicate negotiations
transcanada proposal amounts to quasi debt restructuring oil analyst doug gowland of brown baldwin nisker ltd said from toronto
calgary based dome restructuring plan would allow creditors to convert debt to common shares under formula yet to be negotiated
payments on remaining debt would be linked to cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt
the weakness of the whole debt refinancing proposal is that even with approval of creditors there is no assurance that dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations said wilf gobert an oil analyst for peters and co ltd in calgary
transcanada announcement came as surprise since dome was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed refinancing packages gobert said
the transcanada proposal could open the bidding for dome since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders to agree to restructuring he added
would think that the debtholders would want to entertain any and all offers for dome gobert said
dome spokesman david annesley said in new york that transcanada announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix the bidding price for dome and an effort to preclude other possible buyers from making an offer
by drawing attention to us in our discussions it means that others may be little reluctant to come forward he said
dome does not consider transcanada proposal formal offer because the pipeline utility announcement breached confidential agreement between the two companies he said
dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions with transcanada in order to pursue talks with other unidentified parties
however dome said its management and financial advisers would evaluate all proposals including transcanada
gowland said transcanada offer is probably fair price for the company mln acres of oil and gas land holdings
however he said not enough financial details are known about dome debt restructuring to compare the value of transcanada proposed offer
sosnoff raises bid for caesars world lt caw investor martin sosnoff said he has raised his offer for caesars world inc shares to dlrs each from dlrs and has reduced the number of shares he is seeking to mln from all those not already owned
in newspaper advertisement sosnoff said the bid by his mts acquisition corp withdrawal rights and the proration period will now expire june unless extended
the offer had been scheduled to expire may
in late march sosnoff said he had received negligible number of shares in response to the offer which had been rejected by caesars as inadequate
sosnoff already owns about four mln of caesars mln common shares now outstanding or pct interest on primary basis
last week caesars board approved recapitalization plan as an alternative to the sosnoff offer under which shareholders would receive special dividend of dlrs per share subject to approval by shareholders at special meeting to be held in june
the company planned to borrow mln dlrs and sell mln dlrs in debt to finance the payout
sosnoff said in the newspaper advertisement that the amended offer is conditioned on receipt of enough shares to give him majority interest on fully diluted basis and on the arrangement of financing as well as to approvals by new jersey and nevada gaming authorities
he said the tender would be the first step in acquiring all of caesars shares and if successful would be followed by merger transaction
sosnoff said later in statement that the mln shares he is now seeking together with the shares he owns would give him pct interest on fully diluted basis
he said he still has received only negligible number of shares in response to his tender
in letter to caesars chairman henry gluck included in the statement sosnoff said gluck had again refused on april to meet with him even though he had said he was willing to increase the price of his offer
sosnoff said the financing for the offer is almost fully in place
sosnoff said painewebber group inc lt pwj has now delivered to him commitments to purchase up to mln dlrs of increasing dividend cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of mts holding corp an indirect parent corporation of mts acquisition
he said marine midland banks inc lt mm which leads syndicate that has provided commitments for mln dlr margin facility believes it will be able to arrange for further commitments under the margin facility to advance up to an additional mln dlrs that may be needed to permit the purchase of shares under the offer
sosnoff said under the merger that would follow his tender each of the caesars shares not covered by the offer or pct on fully diluted basis would be converted into series preferred stock valued at dlrs per shareby an independent investment baking firm
he said to the extent that fewer than sdhares are purchased in the offer the stockholders would receive combination of cash and series preferred stock having value of dlrs per share of caesars
sosnoff said he believes terms of his offer are superior to caesars recapitalization
sosnoff said he will be meeting this week with gaming officials in nevada in an effort to expedite the investigatory process required for regulatory approval process that it already underway in new jersey
he said his offer has been extended based on the likely duration of the regulatory process
he said he intends to further extend the offer if the approval process is not completed by the expiration date

portuguese economy remains buoyant despite crisis portugal economy which has been enjoying one of its most buoyant periods in more than decade may now be strong enough to shrug off the country latest government crisis analysts said
but the april ousting of prime minister anibal cavaco silva government could slow economic reforms and investment as portugal continues to adapt to membership in the european community which it joined in january last year they said
cavaco silva minority social democratic party psd was toppled in parliamentary censure vote by left wing parties
the centre right administration had made economic growth reform priority in its months in office
in portugal economy grew four pct its current account surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs and inflation fell to pct from pct in
analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instability were worrying but they felt the foundations for continued growth had not been badly shaken
the economy has developed certain self confidence that is now less dependent on the political situation said fritz haser economics professor at universidade livre lisbon
the market doesn see this as real crisis yet economist jorge braga de macedo told reuters
businessmen have identified political instability over the last years as one of the biggest obstacles to lasting economic progress
the psd administration was the formed since the revolution
portugal developing stock markets however remain buoyant
brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surge in economic confidence under the psd rule was still largely underpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts
investment grew nearly pct in and bank of portugal forecast released on the day the psd government fell predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growth would remain at similar levels this year
but analysts said the crisis interrupted current policies and could slow economic development
soares who is expected to announce decision by the end of the month can either call early elections or form new government from parties in the existing left wing dominated parliament
many businessmen said they strongly favoured quick elections as the best solution
there is good chance that majority government could result from early elections confederation of portuguese industry cip president pedro ferraz da costa said
he said they were optimistic this could mean the continuation in the near future of liberalisation policies introduced over the last year
the left wing parties favour parliamentary solution but the psd said it wants an early election in which opinion polls say they could win an overall majority
psd majority would also open the way for more wide ranging reforms such as relaxation of labour laws and possible denationalisation of industry the analysts said
cavaco silva has accused the left wing opposition parties of blocking key economic reforms
the left wingers said portugal positive economic results were more the product of favourable international conditions such as cheaper oil and raw material imports than of psd policies

columbia gas lt cg seeks contract cost recovery columbia gas transmission corp said it made an abbreviated streamlined filing with the federal energy regulatory commission to recover portion if its costs of renegotiating high cost gas purchase contracts
recently the columbia gas system inc pipeline subsidiary said ferc denied on procedural grounds and without prejudice proposal to include these costs in the company most recent purchased gas adjustment or pga filing
noting it has has asked for rehearing on the denial ruling columbia gas said it would withdraw its alternative filing if the commission grantes its request for rehearing to include the contract renegotiation costs in its pga or consolidates this issue in the pipeline general rate filing and permit recovery subject to refund effective april one
the company said the alternative filing seeks to recover about mln dlrs year through the pipeline non gas sales commodity rates
this annual amortization amount is based on recovery of about mln drls over an year period beginning april
columbia gas said the filing would increase the pipeline commodity rates by cts per mln btu to dlrs per mln
the company said it orginially sought to include these costs in its pga since the payments to products resulted in almost five billion dlrs in prospective price relief and were not related to take or pay buyout costs

trade issues straining ec patience with japan member states of the european community are starting to run out of patience with japan which they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open its market to imports but as often made only minor moves
diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by ec countries bear witness to new disillusionment with the willingness or at least the ability of the japanese government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the ec
however they said an all out trade war may be far off as ec states know they would suffer almost as much as japan
senior ec diplomats gave generally favourable reaction to an ec executive commission proposal under which the ec could raise tariffs on range of japanese products if the
carries out threat to make similar move on april
the ec tariffs which would involve renouncing obligations entered into with the world trade body gatt would be designed to stop diversion of exports to the ec market from that of the
the diplomats were meeting as tokyo announced that the ec trade deficit with japan reached record billion dlrs in march up from billion in february
ec could decide on japan trade moves in late may the european community ec has effectively given japan six weeks to take moves to open its market to imports before it decides on possible tough retaliatory trade measures ec diplomats said
they said ec foreign ministers will meet on may and to review the state of trade relations between the two sides
the ec executive commission was asked by representatives of member states on friday to propose renunciation of some ec pledges to the world trade body gatt unless there are adequate and early measures to open the japanese market
such renunciation would be the first step to imposing stiff increases in duties or quantitative limits on japanese exports
the diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would be discussed in detail at the next meeting of ec foreign ministers on april and in luxembourg as time was needed to prepare proposals for possible retaliatory action
they said the commission has powers to take some limited action before getting ministerial approval to prevent japanese exports of electrical photographic and other goods being diverted to europe following of possible

but in dissenting view the diw institute in west berlin echoing recent statements by leading bundesbank officials said the expansion seen over the last years did not necessarily threaten stability
the five institutes issued joint spring report in which three kiel hamburg and essen forecast two pct rise in gnp in while west berlin and munich predicted one pct
the four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome in view of the slowdown in economic activity
but experience has shown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to price rise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy
given virtual zero inflation in west germany such fears may seem exaggerated they said
but it has often turned out in the past that the price climate can quickly deteriorate forcing the central bank into restrictive policy they said
the economic costs of preventive stability policy are less than fighting inflation once it has taken hold they said
the four institutes disputed the view that monetary expansion would slow of its own accord in as domestic investors switch liquidity into longer term capital market investments following lower interest rates
such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion of central bank money stock but do not automatically lead to smaller expansion of money supply they said
return to growth and stability did not require spectacular central bank moves but could be done quietly with open market operations and repurchase pacts which would avoid an interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations
the diw institute said monetary policy should not be focused simply on growth of production potential
because of uncertainty about exchange rate developments and economic weakness other factors should be taken into account
monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cuts and avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluation speculation
recent strong monetary expansion was not threat in itself to price stability
the inflation following strong money growth reflected other causes such as rising oil prices and the falling mark

banks likely to lift prime rates again soon major banks may lift prime lending rates again within days due to recent increases in their borrowing costs and speculation the federal reserve is nudging up interest rates to help the dollar economists said
in what was the first prime rate boost since mid most banks in early april lifted their rates quarter point to pct citing reduced gap between the prime and their own cost of money
that spread has narrowed again
prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight said robert brusca of nikko securities co international inc brusca said quarter point prime rate rise to eight pct is justified because the spread between banks cost of funds and the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of percentage point
he said that spread had averaged around percentage points since last october until it fell below one point and triggered the april prime rate rise at most banks
we could easily have another prime rate increase as soon as this week said david jones of aubrey lanston and co we ve got fairly good chance of prime rate rise in the near future said allan leslie of discount corp based on the spread between the prime rate and funding costs you would ordinarily see prime rate increase now said harold nathan economist at wells fargo bank
however he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan demand and because some are not sure the fed will maintain recent upward pressure on money market interest rates
nathan believes the fed has let market pressures lift short term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar
he said if there is widespread belief money market rates will stay high prime rate rise could occur at any time
fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep dollar drop could help rekindle inflation
as the dollar fell to year low against the yen friday currency traders said the fed and other central banks supported the dollar
in addition to buying dollars outright another way to stabilize the currency would be for the fed to push interest rates higher relative to overseas rates
based particularly on the fed reserve management actions on friday and today nathan of wells fargo said it has become clear that the fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure in the market
it is supplying fewer reserves than are needed
bank funding costs and other short and long term interest rates rose sharply friday and today on heightened speculation that the fed is gently firming monetary policy
that was because the fed supplied far fewer reserves in the market than most economists had expected
on friday the fed added reserves indirectly and in small amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements with the federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another high at pct
with funds trading even higher at pct today the fed arranged only slightly larger billion dlr round of customer repurchase agreements
the fed actions on friday and today show that it is offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures said jones of lanston
the fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the need to defend the dollar jones said
he believes it is merely shading policy toward restraint now but to have major impact on the dollar the fed will have to tighten policy overtly at some point
jones expects the fed to foster higher market rates by becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and within four to six weeks to raise its discount rate from pct
jones said discount rate increase to six pct might well be accompanied by west german and japanese rate cuts to further aid the dollar
given likely fed policy firming he said both the yield on year treasury bonds about pct now and the prime rate may be at pct at end june and nine pct by year end
the jury is still out on whether the fed is tightening policy to defend the dollar said leslie of discount corp
he said tax date pressures have been pushing up fed funds lately
leslie said fed actions and reserve data once these pressures abate will show whether or not it is firming policy

kuwaiti daily says opec credibility at stake opec credibility faces fresh scrutiny in coming weeks amid signs of significant rise in supplies of oil to international oil markets the kuwait daily al qabas said
in an article headlined gulf oil sources say middle east production up mln bpd it warned opec official prices could face fresh pressure from international oil companies seeking cheaper supplies
it did not say whether only opec or both opec and other producers were behind the reported rise in mideast output
nor did it specify if the sources were official or other contacts

several companies say they are willing to start trading yates told reuters in an interview
the company last week had stated that number of domestic and international oil suppliers were demanding cash for oil shipments and in some cases had cut supplies altogether

chase manhattan corp lt cmb and morgan co lt jpm morgan guaranty trust co asked for deposits to cover transactions it said
the severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arose from an unfavorable ruling last monday by the supreme court in texaco ongoing dispute with pennzoil co lt pzl over the acquisition of getty oil co in
the high court said texas courts must consider texaco plea to cut its billion dlr bond while appealing the case
most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as they could elton said
but following monday supreme court ruling texaco suppliers began demanding cash and halting supplies
it wasn until last wednesday that it turned into an avalanche he said
supplies were cut to the point where we could not run the system at anywhere near capacity
he said less than half of texaco oil supplies had been in jeapordy but the cut off would have produced severe shortages by mid may
now the situation appears much less severe elton said
it said that sonatrach the algerian national oil company canceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas occidental petroleum co lt oxy demanded cash for crude and atlantic richfield co lt arc asked for special safeguards
the company also said british petroleum co plc lt bp last week refused to accept an order for fuel oil
but yates today said big company has in fact said they would go on supplying
they had cancelled last week
he declined to identify the company
lt petroleos de venezuela the venezuelan state oil company that supplies large portion of texaco oil also halted shipments two weeks ago yates said
but he added that texaco expected to meet with the venezuelans later today in an attempt to reestablish that key supply line
talks were also expected to take place with the algerians he added
bankruptcy specialists said it was likely texaco chapter filing would allow the company to secure its credit lines and oil supplies that are key to the company business
it will be business as usual for texaco said martin klein bankruptcy attorney at the new york law firm dreyer and traub
creditors are nervous bunch of people he said
but when the dust settles they will reevaluate the situation and will likely extend credit to the chapter company
but other officials at texaco were not immediately available to say whether discussions were being held with its banks or whether credit lines had been reestablished

in recent months dome has normally moved by only few cents per day
transcanada pipelines yesterday announced billion dlr canadian billion bid for all of dome assets but dome which is based in calgary alberta said it is also still talking with two other companies which it refuses to identify
market analysts today said the other two firms are believed to be foreign oil companies noting that transcanada yesterday stressed that its bid is canadian solution to the financial difficulties of dome petroleum
the talk is about conoco which is controlled by dupont lt dd and atlantic richfield co lt arc which sold its canadian interest in and could be getting back in said wilf gobert of peters and co ltd david bryson of moss lawson and co also noted that british petroleum plc lt bp is mentioned as possible buyer despite bp dlr per share bid two weeks ago for the percent of standard oil co lt srd it does not already own
calgary based independent analyst james hamilton has said in recent reports that amoco corp lt an has also been in talks with dome
representatives of atlantic richfield british petroleum conoco and amoco were not immediately available for comment
gobert characterized the market action in dome today as awfully optimistic given transcanada offer to give current dome shareholders stock in new subsidiary which it valued at dlrs canadian per common share
under the offer current dome common and preferred shareholders would own pct of the new subsidiary which would own and operate all dome former assets
transcanada would own pct
however bryson said the market may be looking at the potential for shares in publicly traded subsidiary
the transcanada offer has quite bit of upside potential for dome he said
gobert said he believes the transcanada offer is at the upper end of what thought somebody would pay for dome
the transcanada proposal would pay dome creditors billion canadian dlrs billion dlrs with another one billion canadian dlrs mln dlrs available to secured creditors if the dome subsidiary earns profits above certain level
transcanada would not detail the profit level
dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billion canadian dlrs billion dlrs in debt which it took on several years ago when oil prices were high and the company wanted to expand
there has been speculation that dome assets are capable of supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs so on that basis the transcanada offer would be at the upper end of that gobert said
dome debt troubles have often obscured the fact that it is major player in the canadian oil and gas field
it holds reserves of about mln barrels of crude oil and billion cubic feet of natural gas
the company also owns or has an interest in mln acres of oil and gas exploration land in the province of alberta the heart of canada oil industry

japan farm reform key to trimming trade surplus basic reform of japan protected farm sector is key to shifting its economy away from export to domestic led growth vital step if it is to trim its trade surplus securities analysts said
the farm sector which is protected by import tariffs and quotas propped up by subsidies and price supports and sheltered by the tax system has ample room for change they said
in economic terms reform would be plus said christopher chew of brokerage firm james capel and co
the ultimate cost of the existing system is food prices twice those in europe and two to three times those in the the analysts said
spending on food accounts for about one quarter of the average household budget and roughly pct of the gross national product gnp according to study by chew
reducing these prices could increase household spending power by five pct his study said
the money could be spent on products which would have more direct impact in boosting domestic growth it added
there lot of slack government official in tokyo said
all that money could be spent on something else
direct central government subsidies to the farm sector amount to some five billion dlrs per year
independent estimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as billion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted
changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farm on weekends to put their land up for sale for residential development would also give boost to domestic spending economists said
housing construction is the key strategic variable in the expansion of domestic demand wrote chihiro nakajima professor at kyoto gakuen university
japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reform to shift some of the burden of trade friction and economic restructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto the farm sector
employers groups also want change
if you really want to expand domestic demand the way to do it is not to raise wages recklessly but to reduce commodity prices bumpei otsuki president of the japan federation of employers associations told recent press conference
external pressures are rising as the and europe seek removal of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their trade deficits with japan
but vested japanese interests opposed to change remain well entrenched dimming prospects for quick reform analysts said
although the full time farm population is falling and there are signs the ldp is paying more attention to urban constituencies the ruling party remains heavily dependent on farm votes in the rural areas
one rural vote is worth several city votes due to the pattern of constituency borders
the ldp is already in political trouble over its tax reform plan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon the analysts said
consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept the traditional view that higher prices are small fee to pay for national food security they said
powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed to import liberalisation but are more flexible about reforms aimed at stepping up productivity they said
reform when it comes will be in response to specific pressure rather than an all embracing program said chew

lyng opens japan talks on farm trade barriers agriculture secretary richard lyng opens talks with japanese government officials today well aware his demand for the opening of japanese rice beef and citrus markets is likely to be rejected
but in an interview with reuters during the flight to tokyo yesterday lyng said the goal of his trip was to throw an international spotlight on japan agricultural import protection in the hope pressure would build on tokyo to open its markets
the japanese have said they are happy we are coming but they are not going to give us anything lyng said
officials do not expect any japanese concessions during lyng two week visit here
any farm trade concessions would be unveiled later this month they said
if there is anything of consequence to offer prime minister yasuhiro nakasone would take it with him when he visits washington later in the month one official said
lyng plans to ask japan to open the door to rice imports by partially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases
private rice trader visited tokyo last week requesting japan buy tonnes of rice for industrial uses such as making sake
japan has rejected the overture saying tokyo maintains policy of self sufficiency in rice
lyng will also press japan to eliminate an import quota for beef by april because he believes japanese consumers would like to buy much more beef than currently allowed
he cited the example of california company which transports live cattle to japan by air for slaughter to circumvent the beef quota
the cost of transport is higher than the value of the animal he said
officials said the japan livestock industry promotion corporation which regulates beef imports was forced to borrow from the fiscal quota earlier this year because the quota was exhausted and japanese beef prices were rising
japan has said it cannot open its markets to beef imports
along with beef the will also press japan to eliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice by april
some officials believe japan may eventually be willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges because liberalized trade would not necessarily damage the japanese mandarin orange industry
the quota on juice may be harder to eliminate because imports might replace domestic produced juice and japanese officials have said
lyng has resurrected past proposal that japan buy surplus foodgrains for donation to developing countries but some officials are skeptical action will be taken
lyng will also urge japan to put its domestic farm policies including rice on the negotiating table during gatt talks in geneva
he said japan must eliminate import quotas on certain minor food products or face possible reprisals
japan details plan to stave off trade problems japan liberal democratic party ldp has drawn up detailed plan calling for large tax cuts and an increase in government purchases of foreign goods the head of the committee working out the plan junichiro koizumi said
the plan will also urge the government to double official development assistance to billion dlrs within five years instead of seven as the government had promised senior ldp officials said at press conference
ldp executive council chairman shintaro abe will explain the plan to officials when he visits the on april
abe visit is to prepare for prime minister yasuhiro nakasone talks with president ronald reagan later this month
koizumi said the ldp plan will not specify the size of the tax cut or the amount of domestic demand to be stimulated
however top ldp executives will work out figures so that abe will be able to offer specifics to officials
the proposed increase in procurement of foreign goods by the government will probably include the purchase of super computers ldp officials said
according to the plan japan will also strive to solve specific trade problems with other nations and will encourage flows of funds to developing countries the officials said
the ldp expects the measures to prop up the economy and lessen trade problems with the they added
the basic ideas of the ldp plan were presented to and welcomed by monetary authorities of the major industrial nations in washington last week they said
the ldp plan will form the basis for the last of several packages to stimulate japanese domestic demand and will be unveiled by the government in late may

reagan to announce decision on japan sanctions president reagan today is to announce decision on tough new tariffs on japanese exports to retaliate for what he calls japan failure to end its unfair practices in semiconductor trade
the pct tariffs are to be imposed on mln dlrs of japanese goods recommended for curbs by special panel of experts headed by the trade representative office
reagan announced last march he would impose the tariffs on certain goods taken from list that ranged from computors and television sets to power tools and photographic film
the panel this week winnowed through the list of the some products and sent their recommendations yesterday to santa barbara where reagan is vacationing
in his march annoucement reagan said am committed to full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide american industry with free and fair trade opportunities
he added the tariffs would be lifted once japan honored the pact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in world markets and opened its home market to products
officials said japan had done nothing since the march announcement to alter reagan plan to invoke the sanctions
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said yesterday we do not want trade war but we feel that this is the kind of action that requires meaningful action
reagan move follows steadily rising trade deicits with last year hitting record billion
about one third of the deficit is in trade with japan
congress is weighing trade bill to force the president to retaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices
he has opposed the legislation saying it would prevent negotiated solutions to trade disputes and in any case that existing law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices
trade experts say his tough action against the japanese was as much to penalize the japanese as to show congress he did not need any new trade legislation
the japanese have complained that they have been honoring the semiconductor pact but that it would take time before the results showed up
officials however have said their monitoring of japanese semiconductor shipments to east asian countries and western europe showed no letup in the dumping and that the japanese home markets remained shut to american exports
japan has said that if reagan imposed the tariffs it would file complaint with the general agreement on tariff and trade gatt
it said hoped gatt would find the retaliation had violated the regulations of the global trading group and would approve compensation or japanese retaliation
officials have said they did not think japan would retaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war with the united states

amoco lt an may buy dome lt dmp report says amoco corp is apparently the successful bidder for debt laden dome petroleum ltd according to published report
the toronto globe and mail quoting sources close to the negotiations today said dome broke off talks last night with transcanada pipelines ltd which last week announced billion canadian dlr offer for all of dome assets
no financial details about the amoco offer were available and dome spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that amoco had emerged the winner the newspaper said
however the dome spokesman indicated that the sale of dome could be finalized and announced this weekend the globe and mail said
representatives of amoco were not immediately available for comment
last sunday when transcanada announced its offer dome said it was also in talks with two other companies but refused to identify them
since then market speculation has centered on amoco and exxon corp lt xon pct owned imperial oil ltd subsidiary in canada
british petroleum plc lt bp and royal dutch shell group lt rd have also been mentioned as possible suitors for dome
in the past two days dome management has been pressured by the federal government to select the offer from transcanada the only canadian company in the bidding
prime minister brian mulroney government appears to want to avoid dome sale to foreign company since the government gave dome hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to encourage oil and gas exploration in the arctic analysts and officials have said
purchase by transcanada would be least likely to run afoul of canadian antitrust laws however transcanada is asking for tax concessions from federal government that is trying to hold its deficit below billion canadian dlrs analysts have said
takeover by amoco or imperial would also give foreign oil company dominant position in canada oil industry
imperial oil is already canada largest energy company with revenues of billion canadian dlrs
chicago based amoco had revenues of billion dlrs
its amoco canada petroleum subsidiary is pct owned by amoco corp

budget chief miller warns fed on interest rates white house budget chief james miller said he was concerned that the federal reserve might overreact to the decline in the value of the dollar by raising interest rates move he said could cause recession next year
our greatest danger is overreaction miller told newspaper reporters yesterday
concerned about the fed overreaction
concerned about what see in recent data showing substantial fall in the money supply
edwin dale miller spokesman said the remarks published in the new york times today were accurate
miller said he was concerned the fed might overreact to signals of rising inflation by tightening credit move he said could have political consequences
the white house budget chief appeared to be referring to the effect an economic slowdown could have on the presidential and congressional elections next year
my fear is that if we get into recession we are in deep soup and there is no question about it he said
miller said an economic slowdown could lead to lower tax revenues and widening of the budget deficit
miller remarks reflected concern that the central bank might feel compelled to tighten credit as means of bolstering the dollar
both treasury secretary james baker and federal reserve board chairman paul volcker recently have warned that further declines in the value of the dollar could jeopardize global growth prospects
officials have urged japan and west germany to stimulate economic growth in their countries move that could boost exports and relieve trade protectionist pressures in the united states
bank of france sees pickup in industrial activity the bank of france said in its latest monthly report on the french economy it expected pickup in industrial production registered in march to gather steam over the next few months

new progress is expected in all main sectors except capital goods where production will remain at its present level the report added
the upbeat report comes in the wake of grim march trade balance figures which showed deficit in industrial trade for the first time since june
while the automobile industry remained unchanged from previously boosted levels consumer goods production grew and was expected to accelerate except in the area of domestic appliances

yeutter says japanese curb all but certain trade representative clayton yeutter said it was all but certain president reagan would go ahead today and impose curbs on japanese exports as planned
asked in television interview what the chance was for reagan to cancel the scheduled pct tariffs on japanese electronic exports he said slim to none
reagan announced on march he would impose the tariffs to retaliate for japan failure to honor agreement to end dumping computer semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its home markets to products
yeutter on the nbc program today said the united states did not want to terminate the agreement and would drop the tariffs once japan began fulfilling the agreement
he said japanese negotiators last week told officials they were honoring the pact but yeutter said it would take time to monitor any compliance
asked how long that would take he said we want to see pattern of compliance so in minimum would say that would take few weeks
yeutter said he did not think there would be much consumer impact by the tariffs on mln dlrs worth of japanese goods because the items selected are also readily available from other countries and manufacturers
he said he did not think japan would retaliate
it seems to me it is not in the interests of either country to get in an escalating conflict
the japanese understand that full well yeutter said
he added japan might challenge the tariffs in the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt but that more of paper kind of exercise and don really expect to see any adverse impact on
yeutter also said he did not see any way the semiconductor issue could be resolved before or during washington visit later this month by japanese prime minister yasuhiro nakasone
he said he hoped the visit which is to have trade as major issue would be productive but don see any practical way to resolve this particular dispute before or during his visit

commerce trade report omits freight costs the commerce department said on that insurance and freight costs for imported goods of billion dlrs were included in the february trade deficit of billion dlrs reported on tuesday
the department is required by law to wait hours after the initial trade report to issue second report on customs value basis which eliminates the freight and insurance charges from the cost of imports
private sector economists emphasized that the commerce department was not revising down the deficit by billion dlrs but simply presenting the figures on different basis
report in the washington post caused stir in the foreign exchanges today because it gave the impression dealers said that the underlying trade deficit for february had been revised downward
the commerce department would like to have the law changed to permit it to report both sets of figures simultaneously
my feeling is the second one is better report but there legislation that requires us to delay it two days said robert ortner commerce undersecretary for economic affairs
but this has been going on for long time and no one pays any attention to the second figure
the billion dlr february trade deficit compared with revised january deficit of billion dlrs
the law requiring hour delay in publishing the monthly trade figure excluding freight and insurance was passed in
reportedly the feeling was the first figure which includes customs freight and insurance allowed better comparison with other countries that reported their trade balances on the same basis
the second figure which would always be lower by deducting freight and insurance presents the deficit in more favorable light for the reagan administration
ortner said he would like to see the law changed to eliminate the hour delay in reporting the two figures
we re considering it he said it one of those dinosaur laws and think it time has come

japanese tariffs seen as worldwide warning the tough trade sanctions president reagan imposed on japanese exports are not only shot across japan bow but also sign reagan will attack unfair trade practices worldwide officials said
but robert crandall trade specialist at brookings institution think tank said shot across their bow can often result in shot in our stern
he said it left the united states open to retaliation
the officials said the pct tariffs reagan ordered on mln dlrs worth of japanese goods will also show congress that tough pro trade stand can be taken under existing laws and no new protectionist legislation is needed
in the past year tough trade action had been taken against the european community over corn and sorghum taiwan over beer and wine south korea over counterfeiting of copyrights patents and trademarkets and japan on tobacco
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters the tariffs up from five pct should be seen as serious signal to other nations on the need for fair trade practices
reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers television sets and some hand tools because japan did not honor an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its markets to products
the tariffs were placed on items which were available from other sources so there would be little effect on the american consumer fitzwater said
reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action especially against japan to end global unfair trade practices and reverse the growing trade deficit
the alternative was that if he did not congress would
the trade gap last year was record billion dlrs and continues to rise with japan accounting for about one third of america overall deficit
but there are other two way deficits with canada west germany taiwan and south korea and reagan officials said the president is ready to fight them all
reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that regret that these actions are necessary but that the health and vitality of the semiconductor industry was essential to american competitiveness in world markets
we cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading practices reagan added in the statement from his california vacation home at santa barbara
he said the tariffs would remain in force until japan abided by the agreement
officials say the action today will show congress which is about to write trade bill he does not like that he already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade
the white house aide said of the tariff action it wasn done to appease congress but because there was an unfair trade practice
the aide added however on another plane it was an example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight unfair practices an that it is not necessary to make major overall of our trade laws
but the analyst crandall said the tariff action was not in the best interests of the united states and that negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue
it very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route he said because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in trade
crandall said the administration is doing this for its political impact across the country and therefore its impact on congress
he said don think it makes lot of sense
but other analysts said it made little difference whether the tariffs were aimed at trading partners or congress and that the main point was that the trading partners were on notice that retaliation was weapon reagan was ready to use
spokesman fitzwater said we don want trade war but the imposition of sanctions showed the united states would act when it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated

fed data provide new evidence of tighter policy banking data released today are too distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetary policy but they do support the market assumption that the federal reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit economists said
it clear that the fed has firmed somewhat
discount window borrowings net free reserves the fed funds rate average and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent with modest tightening said dana johnson of first chicago corp johnson and several other economists now estimate that the fed funds rate should trade between and pct
discount window borrowings in the week to wednesday were mln dlrs day producing daily average for the two week statement period of mln dlrs the highest since the week of december and up from mln dlrs previously
moreover banks were forced to borrow huge billion dlrs from the fed on wednesday the highest daily total this year even though unexpectedly low treasury balances at the fed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in reserves than the fed had anticipated
however economists said it is almost certain that the fed is aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than witnessed this week
they pointed to two factors that may have forced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week
first economists now expect money supply for the week ended april to rise by staggering to billion dlrs partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to pay annual income taxes
as banks checking account liabilities rise so do the reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the fed
required reserves did indeed rise sharply by billion dlrs day in the two weeks ended wednesday but economists said the fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the projected surge until late in the week and so started to add reserves too late
second an apparent shortage of treasury bills apparently left wall street dealers with too little collateral with which to enagage in repurchase agreements with the fed economists said
thus although there were billion dlrs of repos outstanding on wednesday night the fed may have wanted to add even more reserves but was prevented from doing so
it not at all inconceivable that the fed didn add as much as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral said ward mccarthy of merrill lynch economics inc mccarthy estimated that the fed is now targetting discount window borrowings of about mln dlrs day equivalent to fed funds rate of around pct
after citing the reasons why the fed probably has not tightened credit to the degree suggested by the data economists said the fact that the fed delayed arranging overnight injections of reserves until the last day of the statement period was good sign of more restrictive policy
jeffrey leeds of chemical bank had not been convinced that the fed was tightening policy
but after reviewing today figures he said it fair to say that the fed may be moving toward slightly less accommodative reserve posture
leeds expects fed funds to trade between and pct and said the fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate unless the dollar fall gathers pace

us study discusses dropped comsat contel merger congressional study today said the proposed but now apparently abandoned merger of the communications satellite corp lt cq and contel corp lt ctc would technically be legal but could violate the spirt of the law setting up comsat

seoul announces more tariff cuts for south korea will cut import taxes on items including construction equipment photographic film cigarettes and pipe tobacco to help reduce its trade surplus with the united states the finance ministry said
the tariff cuts of between five and percentage points take effect on july
this brings to the number of goods on which import taxes have been cut this year ministry official said
the are among about items on which washington has asked seoul to lower tariffs he added
today announcement follows saturday removal of import curbs on products
for of those products the had had sought free access to the south korean market
this is in line with the government policy to limit our trade surplus with the united states to help reduce trade friction between the two countries the official said
south korea trade surplus with the rose to billion dlrs in from billion in
officials said the surplus was expected to widen further in but seoul would try to hold it below eight billion dlrs
the finance ministry said tariffs would be cut later this month on further items including acrylic yarn and ethylene by an average percentage points in order to check inflation
the officials said the tariff cuts would contribute to holding wholesale and consumer price rises at less than three pct this year
study says tariffs and quotas could backfire the use of tariffs and quotas to reduce the flow of foreign goods into the united states will do little to cut the nation swelling trade deficit government study said
in fact the federal trade commission ftc report said such protectionist policies could make products less competitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost of imported products that are re exported in different forms
such policies are much more likely to hurt rather than help the productive capabilities of the economy it said
the page report written by ftc economists john hilke and philip nelson blamed the rising trade shortfall which climbed to record billion dlrs last year on shifting currency exchange rates and growing consumer demand
other factors commonly blamed for the deficit such as foreign trade practices deteriorating industrial competitiveness high labour costs and government restrictions on mergers added little to the problem it said
although each industry competitiveness affects the level of imports and exports in that industry in general we find that there have been no significant industry specific changes affecting competitiveness that would explain the increase in the overall trade deficit the study said
to the extent any government action is needed to deal with the trade deficits policies should focus on economy wide phenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth the ftc study said
supporting its conclusion that broad based economic shifts were the cause of the increase in the trade deficit the report said it found that nearly all industries lost some domestic market share to foreign competitors in the
it also said it found fairly direct relationship between the increased trade deficit and the influence of shifting currency exchange rates economic growth and domestic demand for goods and services which has outpaced foreign consumer demand
the study examined seven factors which have been commonly blamed for the trade deficit foreign government subsidies and trade barriers to protect foreign industries lack of investment in industry declining research and development in industry high labour costs union work rules the oil prices rises of the and
in each case the study found little or no evidence that the factor had any impact on the trade deficit

philippine coconut chief to lobby against ec tax philippine coconut authority pca chairman jose romero said he would visit brussels later this month to lobby against proposed pct european community ec levy on vegetable oil imports
intend to visit brussels and talk to whoever is putting up this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countries like the philippines romero said in an interview
he said he did not know how much support the levy had within the ec but he said he believed those originally opposed to the tax were under pressure to change their position
romero said group of ec members led by west germany the netherlands denmark and norway were opposed to the tax
but there was danger some of them would be persuaded to change sides and if that happened opposition could crumble
romero said another threat to exports lay in an ec warning that copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained dangerous levels of aflatoxin carcinogenic chemical
he said the ec standard of parts of aflatoxin per million parts of meal which ec countries had been asked to apply by october was too rigid
he said philippine copra cake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin
aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when it is not properly dried or ground
romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in london that the philippines was doing its best to meet ec standards
it was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally but this was likely to take several years of research
copra meal exports were tonnes or pct of total coconut exports in
the meal was worth mln dlrs
romero said he would also visit oxford university department of agricultural economics to discuss ways of avoiding the copra process altogether
there are ways of producing coconut products outside of copra romero said
we can process fresh coconut without drying the meat in the sun
through the wet process we can process coconuts into other food or non food products or we can go to the chemical root
he said there was tendency for agricultural countries to become more protectionist and he expected export prices of coconut products to drop
in the long term we will be getting less and less for more and more production and not comfortable with that he said
with countries like indonesia and malaysia stepping up production of palm oil coconut oil substitute palm oil output had risen nearly pct since romero said
to add to that the
soybean association is spending billions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil by saying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart he said
romero said he expected coconut product export prices to stay up for the rest of the year
they would probably touch high of cents pound from the current level of cents and sharp rise from year ago levels of cents
romero said the philippines was at the end of five year coconut production cycle which showed production tended to fall after two successive years of good harvests
he said and were good harvests and this year to add to the production fall drought had affected output
traders are stocking up and when they have overbought the prices will start declining again
the only sure way to keep prices stable is by processing adding more value he said
coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop by planting other cash crops between coconut trees he said
typical farm may have from to trees sitting on square metres of land
that lot of space romero said
he said the government proposed land reform program would exclude about pct of the coconut farmers because they had less than the proposed seven hectares of land
if the idea of land reform is to increase income levels production and employment then it won happen he said
pca figures show about one third of the country population is dependent on the coconut industry
coconuts are planted on about mln hectares or one fourth of total agricultural land
pemex official says opec output critical to price crude oil prices could remain around dlrs barrel until the end of the year but opec decision on output at its next meeting would be the critical factor an official of mexico state oil company petroleos mexicanos pemex told group of japanese businessmen
adrian lajous pemex executive vice president of international trade said current opec output already appeared to be very near the mln barrel per day level it set itself for the third quarter
production is surging ahead of what was originally planned while demand is growing more slowly than envisaged few months ago he said
he said opec had to look very carefully at what level of production in the third quarter would effectively sustain the dlrs price and that an increase to what had originally been envisaged might soften price levels
the member cartel is scheduled to meet on june in vienna to review its december accord on prices and output
hope opec will follow very conservative attitude in terms of volume decisions lajous said
repetition of what happened last year when opec boosted output and sent oil prices tumbling down below dlrs is always there as possibility he said
hope never again to go through the trauma of
expect other oil exporters have learned their lessons and discipline will be maintained he said
lajous said there was still excess supply and as long as this remains there will be tendency to instability in oil markets but prices should remain around to dlrs during if output remains under control
he said saudi king fahd remarks last month that increased production was not so important as long as incomes would not be affected by the output were very relevant and welcome from such powerful producer

dutch cocoa processors unhappy with icco buffer dutch cocoa processors are unhappy with the intermittent buying activities of the international cocoa organization buffer stock manager industry sources told reuters
the way he is operating at the moment is doing almost nothing to support the market
in fact he could be said to be actively depressing it one company spokesman said
including the tonnes he acquired on friday the total amount of cocoa bought by the buffer stock manager since he recently began support operations totals tonnes
despite this buying the price of cocoa is well under the special drawing rights sdrs tonne level below which the bsm is obliged to buy cocoa off the market
even before he started operations traders estimated the manager would need to buy at least up to his tonnes maximum before prices moved up to or above the sdr level and yet he appears reluctant to do so one manufacturer said
we all hoped the manager would move into the market to buy up to tonnes in fairly short period and then simply step back he added
the way the manager is only nibbling at the edge of the market at the moment is actually depressing sentiment and the market because everyone is holding back from both buying and selling waiting to see what the manager will do next one processor said
as long as his buying tactics remain the same the market is likely to stay in the doldrums and see no indication he is about to alter his methods he added
processors and chocolate manufacturers said consumer prices for cocoa products were unlikely to be affected by buffer stock buying for some time to come

saudi renegotiation of aramco deal moving along saudi arabia renegotiation of its collective agreement with aramco to purchase oil for the latter ex partners is moving along and should lead to fundamental structural change in the contract oil industry sources said
petroleum intelligence weekly in this monday edition said negotiations are moving along for adjustment of the mln bpd joint long term agreement at official prices and volumes and other terms may be rearranged
the agreement signed in january for the months from february to june is up for renegotiation
under the january contract aramco was to purchase mln bpd for the four partners allocated among them as exxon corp lt xon bpd texaco inc lt tx bpd mobil corp lt mob and chevron corp lt chv bpd between them
but an overlifting by texaco inc in the first quarter allowed other companies like exxon corp to underlift its obligations under the contract piw said that that one alternative under consideration is to revert to four individual contracts rather than collective agrement
john lichtblau director of the petroleum industry research foundation inc said that renegotiation of the pact was more of formality as the saudis have each company on separate schedule although separate agreements with the companies would favor one on one negotiations and ensure that contracted liftings occur
the companies will probably follow the saudi wants within limits as they do not want to antagonize them for the long haul he said
lichtblau said that the renegotiations would most likely concentrate on volume rather than price
saudi displeasure with the agreement has long been noted and in april industry publications said that renegotiation were being sought fact later confirmed by reuters with aramco
aramco corp was formerly owned by chevron corp lt chv exxon corp lt xon mobil corp lt mob and texaco inc lt tx but is now owned by saudi arabia which bought its assets although the ex partners have various agreements with saudi arabia

compromise seen likely over conoco statoil dispute norway is expected to seek compromise solution to defuse row between den norske stats oljeselskap lt stat ol statoil and conoco norge over which firm will operate the heidrun oil field government sources said
the sources who asked not to be named said the government will likely recommend that conoco be allowed to continue as the field operator through the development phase with statoil taking over only after production starts in the early
oil minister arne oeien told reuters the government had today discused the heidrun matter but that no final decision had been taken and several questions remained unresolved
it was unlikely the government would announce its decision on heidrun operatorship until after thursday cabinet meeting and after discussing proposed solution with both companies the sources added
this spring norway state owned oil company statoil exercised an option in the heidrun field exploration license that if approved by the government would allow it to relieve conoco as heidrun operator move sharply criticised by conoco
heidrun is often cited by the government and industry as the most likely candidate for the first field development project on the haltenbanken exploration tract off central norway

dutch official rate cut seen still likely cut of about half percentage point in dutch official interest rates is still in prospect although economists said the timing would depend on bundesbank moves
speculation has been rife that the dutch central bank encouraged by strong guilder mark relationship and wide premiums for dutch money and capital market rates over german might lower rates without the bundesbank moving first
last month the central bank lowered its special advances rate to pct from pct after the bundesbank dropped its repurchase tender rate to pct from pct
that rate has remained in force just holding above the five pct official secured loans rate which governs commercial bank borrowings
given strong guilder further fall in the west german repo rate would trigger lower special advances tariff forcing an official dutch rate cut analysts said
in february when the bundesbank cut its discount rate to three pct from pct the central bank only lowered money market rates and removed surcharge over the secured loans rate on lending under its three month credit quota
since then however both the central bank and finance ministry have made it clear they favour lower official rates
in april central bank president wim duisenberg said he would follow any bundesbank cut and last week the finance ministry expressed satisfaction when it raised billion guilders with six pct coupon state loan priced at pct for an effective yield of pct the lowest since
technically analysts said there has to be difference between the secured loans rate which applies to lending under the credit quota and the tariff on special advances which add extra liquidity to the money market
bank economists and dealers said west german move to further lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts would result in the central bank easing the special advance rate provided the guilder mark relationship permitted
the central bank aims to keep the guilder stable around its parity value within the european monetary system of guilders per marks
today foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up guilder cents to guilders per at the fix level that would not permit change in the interest rate differential between west germany and the netherlands dealers said
an economist at abn bank said he expected west german and dutch interest rates to ease in the short term
however he said new wage agreements in west germany had raised inflation expectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates in the longer term
in the netherlands the inflation outlook for is nil or even negative while the latest official economic forecasts point to falling rate of economic growth
it will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement negotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation the abn economist said
he said dutch money supply growth which ran at pct in january could also contribute to some inflation
at amro bank leading analyst said inflation could run to two pct next year
the bank expects dutch capital market rates currently averaging around pct to stop easing in the second half of this year and stabilize around pct

trade bill very dangerous for canada lobby trade bill before the united states house of representatives is very dangerous bill for canadian industry canadian forest industry council chairman adam zimmerman told reporters
by changing the definition of subsidy under countervailing duty law house of representatives bill removes protection for companies that take advantage of widely used government programs zimmerman told media briefing
clearly any industry to which canadian governments grant rights to fish mine cut timber or produce power could be vulnerable to finding of subsidy under this language he said
the canadian forest lobby zimmerman also said the house of representative bill would adopt new way of measuring subsidies that would greatly increase the size of any countervailing duties that might be imposed on canadian resource exports to the
under the bill any difference between canadian prices and or world market prices would constitute subsidy he said
such method would make canadian resource industries vulnerable to similar penalties like pct export tax imposed last january on shipments of canadian softwood lumber to the zimmerman added
canadian negotiators agreed to levy the new tax if forest industry lobby would drop its request for countervail duty on imports of canadian softwood lumber
we represent the first victim of the move to price other countries natural resources according to the system zimmerman said
if we re an example than other resource industries had better watch out he added
zimmerman said the canadian forest industry council plans to discuss concerns about the trade bill with lobby groups from other canadian resource industries

the first would limit the current quota system which has protected ec output for seven years only to flat products and heavy sections thereby forcing other types of steel products into free market competition

lt ca bolsters hand against ibm computer associates international inc mln dlr merger with uccel corp lt uce will eliminate its strongest rival but the company still faces stiff competition from international business machines corp lt ibm wall street analysts said
ibm is still the ruling force in mainframe systems software said scott smith an analyst with donaldson lufkin and jenrette
but the combination of the two companies will clearly present much stronger front he said
besides ibm computer associates will be far and away the most powerful company in the field added hutton analyst terence quinn
that field is segment of the market known as system utilities or software packages that boost the productivity of company data processing facilities by increasing the speed power and efficiency of large mainframe computers
the merger of uccel and computer associates combines the two biggest systems utilities suppliers other than ibm
analysts said the remaining players are mostly small firms that will find the competition much harder than in the past
for computer associates the merger with uccel caps six year acquisition campaign that has vaulted the garden city based company to the top of the software industry
when the deal is completed sometime in august the company revenues will exceed mln dlrs pushing it past microsoft corp lt mfst as the world largest independent software vendor
computer associates founder and chairman charles wang took the company public in and since then he has bought companies and boosted annual sales from mln to mln dlrs for the year ended march
liemandt took charge of wyly sold off its non computer businesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframe computer software
in the company was renamed uccel corp liemandt who said he will leave the company after the merger is completed also turned to acquisitions for growth
on the last day of uccel completed the buyouts of six companies for total of about mln dlrs
for it earned mln dlrs or dlrs share on sales of mln dlrs
the agreement took industry analysts by surprise largely because the companies had been such bitter rivals
also dallas based uccel had engineered strong comeback from the dark days of when as wyly corp it lost mln dlrs or cts share
at that time wyly owned potpourri of different businesses only three of which were involved in computer software
in walter haefner swiss financier and major wyly investor lured gregory liemandt away from his job as chairman of general electric co lt ge computer services unit
computer associates wang and uccel liemandt said at news conference that the merger would give computer users single source for wide range of software products
in addition to system utilities computer associates also sell products for microcomputers while uccel has made inroads in the applications software market where analysts said it has been successful with accounting and banking systems
wang said computer associates would continue to support and enhance both companies product lines but noted that the company will eventually weed out duplicate offerings
he said about pct of the companies products overlap
analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings of current computer associates shareholders by about pct
but they joined wang in forecasting that the deal will not dilute computer associates earnings for the current fiscal year
quinn of hutton said wang has proven track record of completing acquisitions without earnings dilution
therefore he said he would not change his earnings estimate of dlrs share
wang said he would look closely at the combined operations of the two companies and cut duplication in sales marketing and research and development
analysts said computer associates paid premium for uccel
based on friday closing price the company will swap dlrs worth of its stock for each uccel share which is nearly times uccel estimated earnings of dlrs share
stephen mcclellan of merrill lynch research said most software companies are currently valued at about times per share earnings
but the analyst said uccel was worth the premium because of its earnings potential and customer base
wang said haefner the swiss investor would hold about pct of computer associates stock after the merger
he currently owns pct of uccel
the executive said the merger would not alter his target of maintaining sales and earnings growth of pct to pct
in addition he said he expects no problems in having the deal cleared by the antitrust division of the justice department
uccel liemandt declined to say what he will do after the merger but he did not rule out working together with wang

cocoa origins dismayed by buffer stock action traders recently returned from west africa say some producers there are dismayed by the ineffective action so far by the international cocoa organization icco buffer stock manager on buffer stock purchases
one trader said some west african producers are annoyed the buffer stock manager is not playing his part as required by the international cocoa pact to stabilise prices from current lows
so far only tonnes of second hand cocoa have been taken up for buffer stock purposes and this traders noted only on an intermittent basis
they noted the purchases of tonnes in the first week he bought and in the second are well short of the limitations of no more than tonnes in one day and in one week which the cocoa agreement places on him
the traders recently returned from west africa say producers there are unhappy about the impact on cocoa prices so far noting producing countries are part of the international cocoa pact and deserve the same treatment as consumers
london traders say terminal market prices would have to gain around stg tonne to take the icco day average indicator to its sdr per tonne midway point or reference price
however little progress has been made in that direction and the day average is still well below the sdr lower intervention level at from previously
the buffer stock manager may announce today he will be making purchases tomorrow although under the rules of the agreement such action is not automatic traders said
complaints about the inaction of the buffer stock manager are not confined to west african producers they observed
reuter report from rotterdam quoted industry sources there saying dutch cocoa processors also are unhappy with the intermittent buffer stock buying activities
in london traders expressed surprise that no more than tonnes cocoa has been bought so far against total potential purchases under the new agreement of tonnes
carryover holdings from the previous international cocoa agreement in the stock total tonnes
terminal prices today rose by up to stg tonne from friday close basis july at its high of
it seems that when the buffer stock manager is absent from the market prices go up while when he declares his intention to buy quite often the reverse applies traders said

tin traders response muted to kl futures market european free market tin traders made somewhat muted response to plans for kuala lumpur dollar based tin futures market due to be launched in october
traders said the new market would probably be useful trading medium for japan and other south east asian tin interests although european traders generally appear to be reasonably satisfied with the current free market system which has been operating since london metal exchange lme tin trading ceased in october
dealers here will also want to see how acceptable foreign metal will be on the new market and what sort of demand develops for forward deliveries
there is also view among european traders that while the proposed kuala lumpur tin futures market would provide another useful reference point market inaugurated by the malaysian government in the past viewed as major player at times by the trade would make participants uncomfortable
some traders expressed preference for resumption of trading on the london metal exchange but they added that while there has been some behind the scenes discussion on the subject definite move is unlikely until outstanding high court litigation actions have been resolved
spot tin prices on the european free market are currently around stg per tonne for high grade metal in warehouse rotterdam
over the past months the price moved to ten year low of stg in march and rebounded to as high as stg in december
this compares with stg last paid when lme trading ceased in october and record high tin price of stg traded for cash standard grade metal in june of that year
lme warehouse stocks are now near two year low at tonnes having fallen steadily from record high of tonnes reached in february
traders said the free market turned bullish during late last year based on producer forecasts of supply demand deficit of some tonnes
analysts were predicting prices of up to stg per tonne during
however the trend was reversed following strong upswing in sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to stg last month after approaching stg in december
the decline accelerated as producers who had sold very little metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers
there was also lack of significant demand from major steel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year
traders say the itc creditor banks original tin holdings of nearly tonnes have now been almost halved and the bulk of material still available is being held by malaysian and japanese firms which are reluctant to depress the market with unwanted metal
some tonnes were held by banks and brokers after the international tin council itc buffer stock manager halted support operations on the lme on behalf of the members nations of the international tin agreement
the overhang of metal was reduced further by broker shearson lehman brothers which earlier this year reported having sold its itc related holdings and halved its overall tin position
analysts see no immediate sign of rally in european tin prices and movements are still expected to be largely related to currency fluctuations unless significant consumer demand emerges for the third quarter
the association of tin producing countries atpc has made efforts since the collapse of the ita to achieve higher world prices by attempting to bring all major producers under an export control umbrella but to date brazil and china two major producers remain unaffected by the atpc argument and apparently are continuing to offer material at discounts to consumers in main european trading centres dealers said

major oil pipeline shut down by floods flooding in the red river on the texas oklahoma border has shut down the basin pipeline inch pipeline that transports as much as barrels per day of sweet and sour crudes from texas to cushing okla texaco pipeline co spokesman confirmed
the water is rushing by so fast that we can get any divers down to assess the damage but there is some possibility that the pipeline could be up by the end of the week company source said
the pipeline transmits roughly two thirds sour crude and one third sweet crude oil from the midland texas region
texaco sources said that if the pipeline service is restored by friday there would be little problem in restoring oil which has been lost to the flood
but if the pipeline is down more than days it will be difficult to make up without prorationing and we would not like to proration this pipeline if we don have to
the basin pipeline is jointly owned by atlantic richfield corp lt arc shell oil co subsidiary of the royal dutch shell group lt rd and texaco inc lt tx which is the pipeline operator
peter beutel analyst at elders futures inc said crude oil futures contracts on new york mercantile exchange rose to new highs this afternoon following news of the pipeline break
july crude futures of west texas intermediate traded up to dlrs barrel rise of more than cts
cash market prices also firmed on the news with sellers of wti raising offers to dlrs barrel
sour crudes which would be most affected by the pipeline shutdown however were slow to react to the news with west texas sour and alaska north slope holding cts to one dlr barrel below wti respectively
dan stevens manager of public and government affairs at texaco said the company hopes to fix the pipeline in five days but that will depend on when the water level of the red river recedes
there is already evidence that the water level is dropping and it appears the rain has stopped in the area affecting the pipeline stevens said
he said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged was underground and at distance from the red river that flooded
the pipeline runs over the red river and under the subsoil nearby according to stevens
he said some of this subsoil was apparently washed away
the potential for environmental damage is being downplayed at this time despite the volume of oil that runs through this line
texaco stevens said that aerial surveillance has not found any crude on the water in the river or in lake texoma which is nearby

entertainment marketing tops crazy eddie offer quickly growing texas based distributor of electronics products offered mln dlrs for crazy eddie inc lt crzy the leading new york city electronics retailer or one dlr per share more than its founder has bid
the dlr share offer by entertainment marketing inc lt em for crazy eddie comes less than two weeks after founder eddie antar and firm controlled by the belzbergs of canada announced bid to take the store crazy eddie chain private
analysts said entertainment marketing whose revenues and profits quadrupled in may be looking to break into the highly competitive new york city retail market for consumer electronics the nation biggest at time the fortunes of electronics retailers have sagged
the analysts questioned whether houston based entertainment marketing founded by former electronics retailer but whose present buinesses are primarily as wholesale distributors had the management expertise for retailing or was merely trying to drive up the price of the crazy eddie shares it already owns
have mixed feelings said analyst dennis telzrow of eppler geurin and turner dallas brokerage
on the one hand it probably cheap price
on the other hand does entertainment marketing have the management talent to run it and will the crazy eddie people leave
it risky strategy for entertainment marketing said analyst eliot laurence of wessels arnold and henderson minneapolis brokerage
electronics retailing is very management concentrated they want to keep crazy eddie management in place
laurence said that since entertainment marketing already owns percent of crazy eddie million shares it may be trying to get the antar belzberg group to increase its dlr share offer
shares of crazy eddie which have jumped from the high dlr range to above dlrs since the antar belzberg bid was announced may rose another cents monday to share in over the counter trading
antar the reclusive founder of the chain in the new york city philadelphia and connecticut areas said last month that his group controlled percent of crazy eddie shares

earlier today closely held computerland the largest pc retailing chain in the country said it agreed to be bought by an investor group led by warburg pincus and co new york
neither computerland which is pct owned by its founder william millard nor warburg money management and venture capital firm would disclose the value of the transaction

computerland franchise owners pay royalties averaging pct to the parent company

warburg currently manages billion dlrs in venture capital funds and its past investments have included mattel inc lt mat and the ingersoll newspaper chain
it is also money manager with billion dlrs under management
although the pc retailers are benefitting from the strong upturn in pc sales analysts said computerland must make key changes if it is to fend off advances from rivals like businessland inc lt busl and tandy corp lt tan radio shack stores

burlington lt bur hearing to continue tomorrow district court judge eugene gordon said he plans to issue decision tomorrow on burlington industries inc request for an injunction to stop samjens acquisition corp takeover bid for the company
wall street sources have said the outcome of the case could be pivotal in determining the winner in the fierce takeover battle for burlington the largest textile maker
gordon presided over six hours of argument today by lawyers for burlington and samjens partnership formed by dominion textile inc and new york investor asher edelman
hearings are scheduled to continue tomorrow
preliminary injunction would hold up samjens billion dlr offer until the case is decided
burlington had previously agreed to billion dlr buyout from morgan stanley group inc lt ms one dlr per share lower than sweetened dlr per share bid made by samjens last week
burlington has not responded to the new samjens offer
burlington has alleged in its lawsuit that edelman and dominion used illegally obtained confidential information about the company in making their takeover attempt
that information burlington said was provided by james ammeen former burlington executive through painewebber group inc lt pwj
ammeen who had worked for burlington for years had as many as divisions with pct of burlington sales reporting to him
when he left burlington in november burlington said he signed contract promising never to divulge inside information about the company
burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he began working with painewebber employee on hostile plan to takeover the company dismember the company and displace its management burlington lawyer hubert humphrey said
samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information from painewebber but argued the information was public information and could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts or burlington public financial statements
burlington lawyers said painewebber and ammeen met with edelman and dominion in november and continued to meet with them until couple of days before edelman and dominion went public april with their intention to take over the company
burlington lawyers claim dominion board decided to attempt takeover of burlington after ammeen met with the board in february
burlington lawyers said edelman and dominion held discussions with painewebber and ammeen about acting as financial advisers to samjens
but they allege talks broke off because painewebber and ammeen could not satisfy edelman and dominion with written statement that they did not provide inside information
lawyers for samjens contended that painewebber and ammeen withdrew as potential advisers because burlington chairman frank greenberg had called painewebber executive and threatened legal action if painewebber got involved in an effort to takeover burlilgnton
the ultimate question is not the price per share or the profit but rather the permissable standards of conduct for those who would takeover an american company said burlington lawyer humphrey
burlington lawyers also contended that burlington as the largest manufacturer of denim in the united states would be in violation of anti trust laws if it acquired dominion canada largest textile maker
dominion has denim manufacturing plants in georgia which would reduce competition in the denim market the lawyers said
samjens lawyers discounted the concern
they said the market for denim is more fragmented than burlington contends and that burlington has the ability to switch between light weight and heavy weight denim production as demand and price dictate
samjens lawyers also pointed to lawsuit filed by burlington in canada in which it said it was considering bid for dominion
surely what would have been sauce for the goose would have been sauce for the gander said sidney rosdeitcher samjens lawyer

venezuela gets mln dlrs credit for aluminum venezuela has obtained more than mln dlrs in financing for industrial projects and increased its lines of credit for import financing finance minister manuel azpurua said
we can say that we are achieving the recuperation of credit but that cannot be done overnight azpurua said in television interview
he said credit agreement for mln marks will be signed this week with the german state bank kreditanstalt fur wiederaufbau kfw to finance an expansion of the state aluminum company venalum
the credit will be divided into two separate agreements one for mln marks with an interest rate of pct and another for mln marks at pct
azpurua said financing has also been obtained for expansion of alcasa another state aluminum company and for projects in the state steel and petrochemical industries
yesterday he said venezuela obtained two new credits of mln dlrs each for export financing one from credit du nord of france and the other from britain midland bank
the venezuelan government has been criticised at home for failing to obtain new credits despite its insistence on repaying foreign debt according to the terms of rescheduling accord reached last february
azpurua recently visited tokyo hoping to acquire new credits for industrial expansions but clinched no agreements
japanese officials refused to allow new issue of venezuelan bonds until the country regains its triple credit rating
trade data seen as key to dollar trend the dollar recent signs of stability have raised hopes that its month decline may be nearly over but most currency analysts refuse to commit themselves until after the june release of trade data for april
the trade data will be deciding factor to see if the dollar has bottomed out said jim mcgroarty of discount corp
since february the dollar has nearly halved its value against the yen and the mark as part of an officially orchestrated campaign to make goods more competitive on world markets and redress gaping world trade imbalances
on april the dollar fell to year low of yen but has enjoyed modest recovery over the last few weeks topping yen today for the first time in nearly two months
many economists now believe that the dollar has fallen far enough to ease the trade deficit drag on the economy
the trade gap narrowed to billion dlrs in march from billion in february and is expected to show continued improvement in april in volume if not in real terms
keiichi udagawa of bank of tokyo in new york said that if further progress is reported the dollar would head back up towards yen
there is growing consensus that the dollar has bottomed out for the medium term added tom campbell of first national bank of chicago
other factors supporting this bullish view were growing expectations that federal reserve chairman paul volcker would be reappointed for third four year term in august japan larger than expected economic stimulus package last week and more favorably technical chart signals analysts said
the dollar was also aided by japan moves to dampen speculative selling in tokyo and by reports of active central bank intervention to support the dollar
the federal reserve bank of new york said last week that the monetary authorities bought more than four billion dlrs during the february april period the largest amount since the dollar crisis of the late
discount corp mcgroarty described the fed intervention volume as impressive
james neill of marine midland bank was not so positive however the dollar has not yet bottomed out
after the trade data are released the dollar could fall towards marks and yen
similarly natsuo okada of sumitomo bank in new york warned don think the dollar has bottomed out yet

venezuela tightens foreign exchange restrictions venezuela central bank has ordered venezuelan banks and exchange houses to cease foreign exchange operations with brokers based outside the country according to copy of central bank telex made available to reuters
the measure confirmed by brokerage firm here has effectively cut off all foreign participation in venezuela volatile currency market
the telex issued on may was signed by carlos hernandez delfino manager of the bank department of international operations
the telex said the restriction on business with foreign brokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting foreign exchange houses from selling dollars or other foreign currencies to anyone living outside venezuela
in recent weeks the venezuelan government has denied rumours that it intends to impose foreign exchange controls to prop up the weakening bolivar
but brokers said the central bank move is seen as de facto currency control
it is definitely control in the sense that there no longer complete freedom to operate one broker here said
gradually they re imposing restrictions and the direction is towards complete control the broker said
the broker who requested anonymity said virtually all his venezuelan customers had stopped doing business with him since the central bank issued the telex and followed it up with telephone calls
he said that before the restriction was imposed the volume of his firm transactions with venezuela was about mln dlrs day
it was frenetic market it was really quite active he said
the broker said he saw no logical explanation for the prohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediary between venezuelan brokers exchange houses and banks
we weren buying dollars from venezuelans that ridiculous he said
they ve been on rampage against foreigners
the broker noted that two months ago venezuela central bank quietly announced that banks doing foreign exchange business outside venezuela would have to respect new pct reserve requirement
in february the central bank also prohibited trading in bolivar futures the broker said
we used to have forward market he said
for small currency it was miraculous
he said the bolivar which averaged to the dollar in would continue to slip from its current range of to because the central bank was rapidly running out of foreign reserves to support the currency on the free market

tokyo bundesbank schlesinger sees no reason to lower interest rates
tokyo bundesbank schlesinger sees no reason to lower interest rates
no reason to cut rates bundesbank schlesinger bundesbank vice president helmut schlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now
with money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down in may and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark schlesinger told reuters that he was not convinced that further cut in interest rates was needed
the economy is picking up after contracting by seasonally adjusted to one pct in the first quarter from the fourth he added
we may have an increase in gnp starting in the second quarter he said in an interview
concerned by the first quarter downturn the has been pressing west germany to pump up its economy and boost its imports either through fiscal or monetary policy
schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter was mainly due to adverse weather conditions just as occured in
year on year growth was thus about two pct
he estimated that economic growth for the year as whole would probably be between one and two pct
it is not question of monetary conditions if domestic demand does not grow strongly he said noting that interest rates are at historically low levels and funds are ample
schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money stock growth was slowing down from its recent year on year pace of to eight pct well above the bundesbank three to six pct target
he said the target could still be achieved but much will depend on the direction of long term capital flows
heavy inflows particularly in january around the time of the ems revaluation boosted domestic money supply
there is still certain hope that the net inflow of foreign money can be diminished or can even be little bit reversed schlesinger said
major reason for the inflows was the market conviction that the mark was headed higher
as we can see from the market expectations for further revaluation of the deutschemark have diminished schlesinger said
the recent widening of interest rate differentials the fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in very short period and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined towards stabilizing the dollar he said
asked if central banks might act to prevent sharp dollar rise as the did in march when the dollar rose above marks he said this would depend on the circumstances
at midday here the dollar stood at marks
central banks are always in contact about these fluctuations but cannot give any answer how they would react schelsinger said
one has to look at how it the market is moving he said adding it is not only our own case it is also the american case
he said that the west german export industry has been hit hard by the dollar sharp fall and would probably like to see some correction now
but it wouldn be good to have short term fluctuations he said
let us wait and see
it is mainly the strength of the dollar fall in very short period which was little bit of shock than the level of rates as such schlesinger said
the sharp rise of the mark coupled with weak prices of such key commodities as oil had favourable impact on west german inflation down year
although there have recently been signs of inflation picking up he said that this was due to changes in key commodity prices
the underlying inflation rate this year would be unchanged at about one to pct he said
schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth was longer term in that the economy was building up the potential for possible eventual resurgence of inflation
the above target growth of money supply over the past months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness of targets themselves matter which might be taken up at the mid year meeting of the bundesbank council schlesigner said
but he added don see any great pressure to go away from it
japan oil industry decontrol may lead to mergers deregulation of japan oil industry could mean hardship for smaller firms and lead to their merging into bigger refining and marketing groups industry sources said
they said the relaxation of controls was now under review by the petroleum council an advisory panel to the ministry of international trade and industry miti
spokesman for major firm said deregulation would bring about reorganization
if it by product of freer competition we have no choice but to accept it
the council is due to close its discussions on june
the sources said the council was likely to tell miti it should end its year old protection of the industry
it should cut capacity to mln barrels per day about pct of current capacity
quotas should end for crude throughput and gasoline output and oil tariffs should be abolished
they said deregulation was vital to promote more competition and efficiency and most saw it as inevitable
deregulation is taking place everywhere
now it our turn to see if we can survive cut throat competition said source at one major japanese oil company
spokesman for smaller refiner said we ll have hard time surviving but that something we must go through
in addition to our streamlining and efficiency programs for the oil division we will exert efforts towards branching out further into other lines such as real estate and travel agencies he said
larger companies are also streamlining
nippon oil co ltd which had the largest share of refined products sales in the japanese market in fiscal cut nine pct of its refining capacity in fiscal
cosmo oil co ltd the third largest seller of oil products in cut its workforce by some pct last year spokesman for the company said
between and on the recommendation of the council oil companies were integrated into companies within seven refining and marketing groups to improve the efficiency of the industry
oil industry sources said this structure was now likely to be streamlined further into five refining groups
miti means business
it will urge the major seven groups to merge into five to build up their muscles source said
miti official told reuters he did not rule out the possibility of further mergers within the japanese oil industry in the event of the relaxation of oil controls
he declined to officially confirm or deny that the petroleum council had recommended deregulatory measures but said that in principal miti would encourage move towards deregulation

central bank head says philippine growth on target the philippines first quarter growth figures released yesterday indicated the government was likely to achieve its targets central bank governor jose fernandez said in an interview
the national economic development authority neda announced yesterday gross domestic product gdp grew pct and gross national product gnp pct in the first quarter from year earlier
don see anything on the horizon that should cut it growth short fernandez said
neda said gnp had grown pct and gdp pct in the fourth quarter of from year earlier
last year gnp growth put earlier at pct was revised to pct
certainly do not see any shortage in external resources and if gnp growth continues at this level would assume that domestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated and would not be stumbling block fernandez said
think even before the figures came out simply looking at key indicators such as consumption of fuel oil and power showed that the economy was on different track from last year he said
fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in the first and second quarters because of the dry weather and it could drop off in the third quarter
he said the most significant sign of recovery lay in the manufacturing sector which grew by pct after declines in and slow turnaround in the second half of
that is not seasonal thing it is secular he said
he said the government had met all monetary targets set for the first quarter in consultation with the international monetary fund imf
it expected to draw down the fourth tranche from its mln sdr stand by arrangement soon
the philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling mln sdrs from the arrangement expiring on april
fernandez said an imf mission would visit here in july or august to review performance in the january june period
he said imf repayments were projected to total billion dlrs over the period and drawings only mln dlrs
repayments were inevitable and many countries would find their net repayments to the imf rising in the next few years
it means that since there will be net drain on oda official development assistance accounts the commercial banking system will be requested to hold the line he said
it is an internal constraint that exists because the imf debt cannot be rescheduled fernandez said
the philippines rescheduled billion dlrs of its billion dlr foreign commercial debt in march
fernandez said central bank bills introduced in march to mop up excess liquidity had peaked at billion pesos in april
but their unwinding on maturity dates started in october last year had almost been completed
he said auctions of treasury bills whose outstanding level touched billion pesos on may were going well
treasury bills will remain basic monetary tool he said
commenting on the country foreign debt fernandez said think the philippine debt stock looms large because our own receipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leap forward as might have been suitable
the foreign debt is projected by the central bank to reach billion dlrs by the end of
neda said exports totalled billion dlrs in the first quarter while imports were billion dlrs
fernandez said the government had targeted gnp growth of between six and pct this year
he cautioned that while growth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved
fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by some economists that the peso currently pegged at to the dollar ought to be devalued to make the country exports more competitive
by being pegged to the dollar on basket basis the peso has already substantially devalued against all of the country trading partners he said
on the proposed omnibus investment code he said he was opposed to clause which would allow the unrestricted repatriation abroad of investments made during the first two years after the imposition of the code
the imposition of the code scheduled for last january has been delayed by objections from some business groups
think any central bank certainly this one after the events of the past two or two and half years has to be prudent
this is not the time to throw all caution to the winds and not about to do that fernandez said
it would be ideal if we reach point where movement of capital and earnings can be free he said
we have had one year of reasonably good results
certainly we continue to have fairly heavy drain on our external availabilities simply by servicing our debts

german gnp figures publication delayed figures for first quarter west german gnp will be published on june after they were provisionally scheduled for june an official at the federal statistics office said
the official said there had been delay in gathering information for the data which are expected to show that the west german economy contracted in the period
spokesman for the economics ministry in bonn said there was no political motivation behind publishing the figures on june the day after the venice economic summit ends
there is no political motivation
it is purely technical matter he added
the west german government is expected to come under pressure in venice from both the and its european partners to stimulate domestic demand as way of reducing international trade imbalances and contributing to world economic growth
however government officials have ruled out any further tax reduction packages to supplement major program of stimulatory fiscal measures already underway

but year on year growth is expected to be about two pct
schlesinger today repeated the bundesbank reluctance to cut its official interest rates further
its key discount rate at three pct is just above historical lows
west german officials are likely to emphasise at the venice summit that domestic demand which draws in goods from abroad is already outstripping export performance which has suffered from an pct rise of the mark against the dollar in just over two years
the government has pointed out that depressed exports are the main reason for the current weakness in the economy but says that later in the year stronger domestic demand will compensate for this setback
it expects gnp growth for the whole of of just under two pct after pct rise in

poehl looks set for eight more years at bundesbank for currency dealers karl otto poehl is the scourge of speculators for bankers he is the man who has played key role in shaping the world financial destiny for the last seven years and for germans he is the guardian of the mark
president of the powerful and independent west german central bank the bundesbank poehl is likely to have his contract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the end of this year government officials say
index of economic spotlights see page ecra but no official announcement has yet been made raising eyebrows in west germany business community
the ebullient poehl spent seven years in bonn in top ministerial posts under the social democrats now in opposition before he moved to the bundesbank
there has been speculation that chancellor helmut kohl would try to replace poehl with man closer to his own christian democrats
but officials noted that poehl has worked closely and successfully with finance minister gerhard stoltenberg since kohl government took office in
poehl the most senior central banker apart from paul volcker of the united states enjoys strong international reputation which it would take newcomer years to build up
given these circumstances kohl will probably overlook poehl past as an adviser to former social democrat chancellor willy brandt and top aide to helmut schmidt when he was finance minister bankers said
it was schmidt who as chancellor appointed poehl to his present job in
in recent months with the mark strong rise against the dollar poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of the bundesbank council highly conservative institution which has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent inflation catching hold
older germans can remember two bouts of galloping inflation this century
but with consumer prices falling for much of and inflation negligible so far this year poehl thinks it is safe to relax the monetary reins little and concentrate on the dangers to the german economy of bloated exchange rate
am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the dollar mark rate have reached high priority also for the bundesbank because further massive revaluation of the mark would endanger the economy in west germany he told business journalists in frankfurt recently
ute geipel head of research at citibank ag says that poehl reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy
poehl policy has always been policy which does not focus so rigidly on domestic factors but also on the external economy she said
an economist at german bank who declined to be identified said if poehl is confirmed in his post it will certainly be plus for the pragmatic course which is not so rigidly oriented towards money supply
one of poehl great struggles recently has been to persuade the united states to stop talking down the dollar
for poehl the significance of the february louvre accord was that the united states agreed to join efforts to stabilise currencies
the louvre accord was greeted with scepticism by currency dealers who said they would soon put it to the test
but in fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact
this is because the markets know or perhaps because they don know what the central banks can do poehl says of intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates round making speculator position worthless
poehl was born in and worked as financial journalist in the before starting his ministerial career
relaxed sun tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over glass of beer he is hardly stereotype central banker
he is also keen sportsman who likes to watch football and play golf
poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute for correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced
but you can achieve an enormous effect with small amount if you strike at the right moment he said
bundesbank dealers are very professional and skilled
they ve burnt the fingers of many people he said
and unlike the speculators poehl notes the bundesbank dealers usually make profit

china seen unlikely to raise sugar imports china will not increase sugar imports substantially this year because of foreign exchange constraints and large stocks despite falling production and rising domestic demand traders and the official press said
despite rapid increases in domestic production over the last years imbalances between supply and demand continue to be extremely serious the farmers daily said
it said plantings fell due to removal of crop incentives because farmers could earn more from other crops and because technical and seed improvements had not been widely disseminated
the official press had estimated the sugar crop november march at mln tonnes down from mln year earlier and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes year
the yunnan sugar harvest was record tonnes the provincial daily said
it gave no year earlier figure
output in guangxi was mln tonnes the new china news agency said without giving year earlier figure
the nanfang daily said production in guangdong province fell to estimated mln tonnes from mln and that the area under sugar was dropping
supply of cane in guangdong is inadequate the newspaper said
processing costs are rising and the economic situation of nearly all the mills is not good
to guarantee supply of cane is major problem
western diplomat said sugar output also fell fujian south china fourth major producer where there was drop in area planted
he said the rural sectors in guangdong and fujian were wel developed enabling farmers to choose crops according to the maximum return meaning that many had avoided sugar
the farmers daily said peasant in the ortheast province of heilongjiang could gross yuan from one mu hectares of soybeans and yuan from one mu of corn but only from one mu of sugarbeet
the paper said the profit margin of mills in china fell to pct last year from pct in
mills lacked the capital to modernise and they competed with each other for raw materialsx it added
this resulted in falling utilisation rates at big mode nised mills
the price of sugar had not changed in years the official press has said
customs figures showed china imported mln tonnes of sugar in calendar down from mln in
the diplomat said stocks at end august were mln tonnes up from year earlier
foreign trader here said china accumulated large stocks in when provincial authorities were allowed to import sugar on their own authority
this practice was stopped in when the central government resumed control of imports
as china lacked storage much of these imports was stored in qinghai inner mongolia and other inland areas the diplomat said
the trader said transporting stocks from these areas to consumers in east and south china was problem particularly as coal had priority
how quickly they can move the sugar is one factor determining import levels he said
another factor was the quality of the harvest in cuba china major supplier through barter trade he said
china bought two distress cargoes last week for about dlrs tonne he added
china is not desperate buyer now
but if the cuban harvest is bad it will have to go into the open market
japanese trader said peking major concern regarding imports was price
while the foreign trade situation has improved this year foreign exchange restraints persist he said
the diplomat said domestic demand was rising by about five pct year but communist government is in much better position to regulate demand than capitalist one if the foreign exchange situation demands it

the central bank statement added that the measure would be effective until the end of july
bankers said the measure is designed to curb the inflow of foreign exchange and slow the growth of money supply

dollars from banks to pct from pct of the value of the contract

reserves lift hopes of further base rate cut the record billion dlrs rise in reserves in may to total billion has lifted hopes for further cut in bank base lending rates after the june general election market analysts said
sterling would have risen on the much better than expected number but for market nerves about the poll outcome they said
but the weight of foreign currency and gold reserves now available to the authorities to support the pound should curb any market tendency to panic if opinion polls show the ruling conservative party lead slipping they added
we have been intervening to very much greater extent than we have done hitherto chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson said at news conference today commenting on the news of the record reserves rise
he put the
intervention in the context of the louvre accord between leading industrial nations to stabilise the dollar partly through direct intervention on foreign exchanges
we have been playing very full part ourselves he said
but market analysts see the recent upward pressure on sterling and consequent need for official sales to damp down its rise more in the light of local factors
steven bell chief economist at morgan grenfell securities said that corporate money has been flowing back into britain amid hopes of another conservative government after fears last autumn of labour election victory sent it flooding out
portfolio investment is also returning while foreign buyers see growth propects and high bond yields as attractive
they will be strong buyers of assets notably equities once the election is out of the way bell said
analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lower interest rates as the government is expected to try to reverse the loss of export competitiveness caused by strong pound
today however the pound hardly moved on the reserves news dipping on its trade weighted index against basket of currencies from pct of its value at gmt to pct at gmt half an hour after the figures were released
the market doesn want to do anything because of the election commented an economist at big investment bank
several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts of rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs had overestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely to have been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on the forward market
the market also seemed to have overestimated the amount of sterling the bank of england bought at the end of may to smooth the pound sudden downturn while some of the intervention reported in may probably occurred in april they said
the key three months interbank money market rates eased about point reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrend in interest rates will be revived following the reserves news analysts said
government bond prices initially firmed but the market was muted as traders worried about the funding implications of another huge rise in reserves they added
morgan grenfell bell forecast half point base rate cut from the current nine pct level soon after the election so long as poll projections of another conservative victory prove accurate with another half point later
justin silverton equity economist at credit suisse buckmaster and moore said full point reduction might be possible
sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts in future rather than this active intervention he predicted
kevin boakes of greenwell montagu gilt edged cautioned against over optimistic forecasts but agreed half point cut looked likely
cut before the election has been virtually ruled out
the bank of england is both worried about the political problem of cutting rates during an election campaign and has signalled some worry about broad money growth said robin marshall chief
economist at chase manhattan securities
he said the billion dlrs increase in total reserves in the past seven months may foreshadow full
entry into the european monetary system
but bell said the authorities would like to see another or billion dlrs in the reserves before joining if they did so
but unlike many analysts he doubted the will go in

africa expected to unveil expansionary budget south africa is expected to unveil tomorrow an expansionary budget for the second consecutive year in bid to boost the nation flagging economic growth rate economic analysts said
faced with competing demands for increased military and police spending and the pressing need for more funds for black housing and education finance minister barend du plessis is expected to raise significantly the government overall expenditure targets when he presents the budget to parliament the analysts said
analysts expect du plessis to provide for rise in state spending at least equal to the pct inflation rate for the financial year that started on april while ignoring pleas from the private sector to stimulate growth by cutting taxes
fiscal policy has become gradually more expansionary but simply raising government spending and increasing the budget deficit is an inflationary form of stimulation said rob lee chief economist at south african mutual life assurance co south africa this year is targeting inflation adjusted growth in gdp of three pct against an increase last year of less than one pct
growth in gdp over the past decade has averaged about pct while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled to over pct
economists estimate that the government spending target will rise to about billion rand with revenue budgeted at around billion rand
this would leave budget deficit before borrowing of about seven billion rand or four pct of gdp
the government having consistently overshot its own spending targets for more than decade also faces credibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in the budget analysts said
the budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure said standard bank ltd in budget preview
many analysts in the private sector are now paying less attention to the figures presented in the budget and are using their own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for the money and capital markets
south african mutual lee believes government spending will again exceed the budget target and increase to around billion rand this year leaving deficit of between and pct of gdp compared with three pct limit suggested by the imf
the imf limit is obviously going to be abandoned predicted one analyst noting that south africa has moved steadily away from austerity measures recommended by the imf over the past two years
the policy shift followed dramatic deterioration in the political situation and the onset of an economic crisis triggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll over loans to the country in september
against background of western economic sanctions falling per capita incomes rising joblessness and high inflation government officials say economic growth is the prime objective
but private sector economists caution that the government ability to promote growth by boosting state spending is constrained by the need to maintain large surplus on the current account of the country balance of payments
most of that surplus this year estimated at around billion dlrs will be swallowed up by repayments on the nation estimated billion dlr foreign debt in terms of an arrangement reached earlier this year with major international creditor banks
within these constraints economists believe du plessis has little room to manoeuvre
analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries and budgeted spending increases for the state owned post office and south african transport services suggest that major tax concessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely
du plessis earlier this year announced small concessions for taxpayers in mini budget before the may whites only election
the poll delayed presentation of the national budget
this will not be very exciting budget commented harry schwarz spokesman on finance for the liberal progressive federal party
do not expect any major tax cuts as all the sweets were given out before the election

lawson says louvre currency accord satisfactory the louvre agreement by the group of seven finance ministers and central bankers to stabilise currencies has worked well and needs no fundamental strengthening at the economic summit in venice on june chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson said
previewing the summit which he expected would not produce any major new economic initiatives lawson told reporters work remained to be done on improving the conditions for lasting world economic growth üside measures to boost growth he said
think it is possible that there may be scope for further reduction in interest rates in germany he added but stressed that he had had no indication that such move was likely
he made no mention of japanese interest rates
lawson said the should embark on gradual reduction of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years
he said the february louvre accord had produced satisfactory exchange rate stability in part thanks to heavy coordinated intervention of group of seven central banks and he was content with sterling exchange rate
pointing to the record billion stg rise in may currency reserves announced today he said we have been playing very full part ourselves we have been intervening to very much greater extent than we had done hitherto
lawson said there was risk that the louvre agreement may falter if member states did not implement the macro economic commitments underlying the accord
certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their commitments in paris
in this respect
he said the budget deficit was very important
noting the billion yen economic package announced by japanese prime minister yasuhiro nakasone last week lawson said what is really needed in japan is an increase in merchandise imports
supply side measures are critical
there is specific range of consumer and agricultural goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is wholly unjustified he said
lawson doubted that tokyo partners would indulge in japan bashing at the summit especially after the economic stimulation package and the announcement of nakasone plans to increase japanese development aid over the next three years
japan more flexible stance on tokyo stock exchange membership would also help deflect criticism he said
he said he thought west germany would instead come under pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to jack up faltering economic growth
in this respect lawson said he hoped bonn would bring forward to january part of its agreed package of tax cuts scheduled for
he also called on bonn to push ahead with the privatisation of german national industries
on debt lawson said he expected three point british plan to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub saharan countries to make progress in venice
the plan involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign debt in the paris club was first proposed at the imf and world bank meetings in washington earlier this year
lawson said he would seek to consolidate political backing for the plan at the venice summit and hoped the programme would be finalised at the autumn meetings of the imf and world bank
he welcomed the recent moves by citicorp and chase manhattan to increase sharply their third world debt provisions
first it is blow for realism
second because the market response has shown that banks have much less to fear from this sort of move than they felt before citicorp he said
banks should follow bank of england recommendations strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions
they have done it to some extent they need to do it more lawson said adding it was up to the banks themselves to determine the appropriate size of provisions
he also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be discussed at the summit
there is consensus which we have to push further

csr says it is proceeding with offer for monier csr ltd lt csra intends to proceed with its planned bid for building materials group monier ltd lt mnra despite the counter bid from lt equiticorp tasman ltd etl csr executive director gene herbert told reuters
etl said today it would offer dlrs each for monier issued capital of mln shares plus share alternative
this compares with dlr cash element in csr proposed bid
the proposed offer by etl controlled by new zealand entrepreneur allan hawkins came after it built up pct stake in monier in mln dlr share raid in recent days
herbert said britain redland plc lt rdld which holds just under pct of monier still supported the csr bid and had told csr it is not seller
he said redland wanted to maintain and build on its operations in australia and the where monier has built up strong presence notably in roofing tile manufacture
the csr offer contains put and call option agreement with redland
this enables redland to accept the csr bid within six months of its close or to lift its stake to pct in the same period and to run monier as joint venture with csr
csr has said that redland will take up the second option
etl has declined to say why it intervened in monier beyond describing it as long term investment
etl would bring no synergies to monier unlike csr which is leader in building materials herbert said
we fit better with monier he said
csr has said that it will concentrate development on its core businesses of sugar and building materials after its moves into energy several years ago
asked what he thought etl bid sought to achieve herbert said puzzled as to what hawkins strategy is
one has to wonder if monier is the main target
herbert said csr had no plans to raise its bid and said higher price would be difficult to justify on fundamentals
monier was trading at dlrs when csr launched its original bid of or times earnings in late april
the shares closed at dlrs today down cents on yesterday after etl withdrew on reaching the top foreign shareholding level permitted without foreign investment review board firb approval
its bid is subject to firb approval
herbert also said that institutions which are more likely to accept share alternative than cash would have to judge the respective values of etl and csr shares
etl is the third group to become involved in possible acquisition of monier this year
redland held discussions on possible takeover before the csr bid emerged but the negotiations foundered on the price
share analysts said that for this reason they did not think etl intervention would flush out full redland bid although monier ultimate fate rests in its hands
redland is still in the driving seat said tim cohen of lt ord minnett ltd adding that redland would be happier having csr as partner in running monier than etl
monier independent directors have recommended etl bid

chicken not main salmonella cause official says representative of the poultry industry said statistics showed that chicken is less frequently the cause of salmonella poisoning than beef dairy products or salads and other mixed foods
kenneth may president of holly farms poultry industries and director of the national broiler council told house agriculture subcommittee the incidence of salmonella in chicken has not increased in recent years and that chicken is neither the major source of the bacterial poisoning nor the cause of an increase in outbreaks of the disease
may said the center for disease control figures showed that between and chicken was involved in four pct of all salmonellosis outbreaks while beef accounted for ten pct of outbreaks and dairy products six pct
may said the remaining outbreaks were caused by salads and mixed food turkey seafood pork eggs and other foods
may said the chicken industry favored moving away from bird by bird inspection procedures to risk assessment system better able to identify microbial and bacterial contamination of poultry
however ellen haas executive director of public voice for food and health policy said bird by bird inspection should be retained and labels should be attached to each ready to cook chicken to remind consumers about preparation procedures necessary to avoid illness
haas also called for review of present chicken industry inspection methods that she said can worsen poultry hazards

lawson calls intervention proof of stability goal the scale of foreign exchange intervention the bank of england has carried out recently is clear proof of britain determination to stabilise exchange rates as agreed between the group of seven industrialised countries in paris in february chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson said
saying he was content with sterling current value lawson told reporters he wanted to maintain the exchange rate stability we have all signed up for
he declined to say if he favoured rise or fall from present sterling levels
may currency reserves out today showed record billion stg rise pointing to massive currency intervention
in april reserves rose hefty billion stg
pointing to the reserves data lawson said we have been playing very full part ourselves in meeting our commitments toward exchange rate stability as agreed in paris
we wish to see it stability continuing he added
asked which techniques were available to preserve stability lawson said both central bank intervention and interest rate changes could be used to tackle the market pressures there are from time to time
interest rate stability is not an objective in that sense rates have to be moved up and down at times he added
lawson said he expected intervention to be sterilised by draining excess sterling liquidity from the market through new issues of government securities and foreign currency sales when the market allowed
this would limit the inflationary impact of intervention he said
sterilisation will be dictated by market tactics not necessarily in the month in which intervention occurs lawson said
am confident that we can sterilise on this scale

judge to decide burlington lt bur in several days district court judge eugene gordon said he will decide in the next few days whether to grant burlington industries inc request to stop takeover by samjens acquisition corp do not know how come down on this preliminary injunction gordon said after listening to arguments by attorneys for days
it been long time since was deluged with as much information as have been
have to consider what been presented and issue an opinion on this
both sides cannot be winners he said
burlington requested the injunction to stop takeover effort by samjens claiming the partnership used illegally obtained confidential information about the company to make its offer

lukman sees stable oil price for next couple years the current crude oil price of between and dlrs barrel will remain stable over the next couple of years rising only one to two dlrs barrel per annum to keep up with inflation opec president rilwanu lukman said
lukman who was speaking during talks with swedish trade officials said the stable price depended upon output restraint by both opec and non opec oil producers swedish government officials said
they said lukman who is also nigerian oil minister made the remarks whilst talking about the connection between third world debt and industrialised nations
crude oil output controls did not necessarily mean higher energy bills for the world industrial nations lukman said
although very low oil prices such as those seen around the beginning of the year may appear beneficial for the industrial countries that depend on imported energy they would only lead to wastage and overdependence on the fuel in the long term he said
this in turn would bring swing back to extremely high prices he added
sweden heavily dependent on imported oil suffered major crisis in the mid when oil prices spiralled
bundesbank credit policy changes unlikely the bundesbank is unlikely to change credit policies when its central bank council meets on thursday for its last session before the venice summit banking economists and money market dealers said
the bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts and is unlikely to cap this move with cut in leading interest rates in the near future they said
the council will meet in saarbruecken and the meeting will be followed by news conference at around gmt
but bundesbank officials noted that news conference was usually called when the council meets outside frankfurt and did not necessarily herald any policy moves
bundesbank vice president helmut schlesinger said today there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply growth had shown no signs of slowing in may and the dollar was stable against the mark
schlesinger told reuters in tokyo where the bundesbank has opened representative office that the west german economy was now picking up after contracting by seasonally adjusted to one pct in the first quarter
money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in pct range for most of this month after the bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at minimum bid rate of pct allocating funds at pct
they have set this signal and indicated they could maybe lower market rates even further but not with the discount or lombard winfried hutmann chief economist of schroeder munchmeyer hengst investment gmbh said
werner chrobok managing partner at bethmann bank said german rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and around historical lows for west germany
further cut in rates would have little impact on the economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand with companies swimming in liquidity chrobok said
the bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make move on interest rates when this would be better held in reserve
the bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder he said
cut in the discount or lombard rates to bring them in line with the new structure of money market rates since last month would have little practical significance dealers said
the bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted diplomatic gesture before next week venice summit
but bundesbank president karl otto poehl has often made it clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere eyewash
economists said it was really up to the bonn government to cut taxes rather than for the bundesbank to ease monetary policy to meet pressure on west germany at the venice summit
but with bonn struggling to finance already announced tax cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget deficit it is hard to see how bonn could cut taxes further
the bonn government will be in very weak position in venice because they can risk increasing the deficit further said schroeder muenchmeyer hengst hutmann
bethmann chrobok said if anything is to happen before venice it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy
but don expect any convincing measures he said
money market dealers noted that call money continued to normalize today falling to pct from yesterday and as much as five pct on friday when it was pushed up by month end distortions
call money could come under upwards pressure later this month because of major round of tax payments by banks on behalf of customers starting in the week beginning june
two public holidays that week could also distort the market
dealers said they expected the bundesbank to allocate funds tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged pct after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of pct and to fully replace the billion marks in an outgoing pact
but dealers said it was possible the bundesbank would allocate funds at pct rather than
that would not represent tightening of policy however
because the bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates at the minimum accepted rate some banks may try to get full allocation by bidding heavily at pct dealers said
on another issue poehl has said the bundesbank is likely to lift restrictions on private use of the european currency unit ecu at one of its meetings soon
saarbruecken would be suitable place for an announcement on this gesture to european unity as it is the capital of the saarland bordering france and was twice under french occupation this century
but dealers said an ecu announcement was unlikely to come this week as number of technical and legal matters had still to be resolved for instance how german ecu accounts would be treated for minimum reserve purposes
alcan reduces cost of planned smelter alcan aluminium ltd said it has cut the expected cost of its planned laterriere quebec smelter by using enhanced grande baie reduction technology

as result it said the estimated total cost of the planned smelter will be held to mln dlrs the low end of the range estimated in mid may while the cost of the first phase was cut to mln dlrs from the projected mln dlrs
german experts say no further economic stimulus the west german government independent council of economic experts believes further stimulation of the economy is inappropriate government spokesman friedhelm ost said
statement released by ost after meeting of chancellor helmut kohl and senior government officials with the council said the experts believed ecomomic growth of to two pct was achievable
it added the council believed an intensification of the already expansionary stimulation of monetary and financial policy is not called for
ost statement said experts believed further pressure on west germany to adapt to external economic factors would not increase
the government regularly uses the term changed external economic factors when referring to the fall of the dollar which has severely damaged west german exports
bonn officials have said they expect exports to pick up during the year but could still fall below the level
along with other leading industrial countries west germany agreed to package of measures at meeting in paris in february aimed at stemming the fall of the dollar
the stance taken by the experts backs up the official position of the west german government ahead of next week seven nation summit in venice where bonn is expected to be pressed by the and other partners to boost its economy
west german government officials have stressed bonn is not in position to stimulate growth further since tax cuts due next year and are already stretching the budget
the bundesbank has also ruled out quick cut in official interest rates although it sees market rates continuing low
the experts prediction for economic growth this year of between and two pct is slight downward revision from forecast made last november when two pct growth was forecast
many independent forecasters have revised down predictions in light of the downturn in exports
the government itself has said it expects growth of just under two pct compared with pct expansion in

ex usda official urges chicken handling labels former agriculture department official urged the department to require that packages of chicken be labeled with handling and cooking instructions to protect the public from disease
carol tucker foreman president of foreman and heidepriem and former assistant secretary of agriculture for food and consumer services told house agriculture subcommittee every hour of every day americans become victims of chicken contaminated with salmonella
she said every two and half weeks an american dies of salmonellosis or complications arising from it and the incidence of poisoning from poultry has increased steadily over the past several years
foreman said usda should follow national academy of sciences recommendation to label chicken packages to remind consumers of preparation procedures necessary to avoid illness
she urged usda to require that birds be washed thoroughly before they are defeathered and that defeathering machines be cleaned several times day that birds be condemned if their intestines are punctured or there is visible fecal contamination and that chiller water be changed more often

weighs lifting japanese trade curbs the white house has completed new review of japanese semiconductor trading practices but has not yet decided whether trade sanctions levied against japan last april should be lifted officials said
they said the president economic policy council looked at japan adherence to the japanese semiconductor pact yesterday and that an announcement may be made shortly
but there was no hint what the announcement might be
officials have said the pct tariffs on mln dlrs of japanese exports could be modified if japan was found to be honoring portion of its semiconductor pact
but they also noted that the white house has said it was unlikely the tariffs would be lifted before the meeting of the world seven major economic powers in venice on june
the officials added that while the curbs complicated japanese economic cooperation they did serve to blunt congressional criticism that the reagan administrtation was not taking tough actions to reduce he trade deficit
reagan imposed the sanctions on april in retaliation for japan failure to honor commitments to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than production costs and to open its own market to goods
the sanctions were levied on certain japanese television sets personal computers and hand held power tools
reagan in imposing the curbs said they would be lifted as soon as there was evidence of pattern that japan was adhering to the pact

leutwiler wants firmer mark against sfr fritz leutwiler chairman of bbc ag brown boveri und cie and former swiss national bank president urged the national bank to declare its intent of achieving rising rate for the mark against the swiss franc
in speech to shareholders leutwiler said gradually rising rate for the mark in relation to the franc would be desirable from the standpoint of industrial exports and with regard to sustaining swiss industry
simply an appropriate declaration of intent by our bank of issue swiss national bank could have positive effect he said
leutwiler who served years as head of the swiss central bank said such step would not contradict the national bank target of monetary stability
bringing the franc close to the mark would of course have to be done step by step under the watchful eye of monetary policy he told shareholders
realistically there is in fact no persuasive reason why the german currency is quoted almost pct lower than the swiss
national bank spokesman said the relation of the mark and swiss franc was an example of stable currency parities over long period of time
the spokesman said exchange rates were made by the market not the central bank and it would be impossible to influence individual parities separately
leutwiler said the swiss national bank could not support the value of the dollar even in conjunction with other central banks without putting monetary stability in jeopardy
would be the last to recommend that
the key to stronger dollar lies in the united states itself leutwiler said
spectra physics lt spy mulls sale restructure spectra physics inc said it is considering the possibility of recapitalizing restructuring or seeking buyer for the company following its rejection of an unsolicitied dlr share bid from ciba geigy corp
in filing with the securities and exchange commission the san jose calif gas lasers and accessories company also said its board sunday agreed to plan that gives top executives bonuses ranging from to pct of their base salary if they stay with the company through august
in rejecting the takeover proposal by the subsidiary of swiss based ciba geigy ag the company said it was unfair
the spectra physics board voted unanimously with two ciba geigy representatives not participating to reject the swiss based chemical and pharmaceutical company takeover bid citing an opinion from its financial advsior morgan stanley and co inc that it is inadequate and unfair from financial point of view to the holders of shares the company said
the board also authorized special committee and morgan stanley to vigorously investigate pursue and authorize any alternatives which would maximize the value of shareholders investment in the company the company said
among the alternatives the special committee will consider are sale of the company to third party for more than dlrs share recapitalization or restructuring including self tender offers and or asset dispositions through the use of dividends spectra physics said
the retention plan for the top officers will pay an average bonus percentage of pct of salary it said
spectra physics said its board approved the plan in order to encourage key operating personnel to remain with the company during the period of turmoil and uncertainty engendered by the ciba geigy offer
under the plan the executives would be entitled to their cash bonuses if they stay with the company through august but could receive them earlier if they are fired for reasons other than gross and willful misconduct or if they leave the company because their salaries have been sharply cut
spectra physics also said it filed suit against ciba geigy yesterday in district court in wilmington del charging it with making takeover bid that was false and misleading in violation of securities law and with violating the intent of july standstill agreement
spectra physics said ciba geigy indicated at the time of the standstill agreement that it would not make an unsolicited takeover proposal for the company and that the intent of the agreement was that ciba geigy would not acquire more than pct of the company unless there was another takeover threat
ciba geigy was pct of spectra physics and reliance group holdings lt rel which is controlled by new york investor saul steinberg controls pct
spectra physics said the agreement prevents ciba geigy from raising its stake beyond pct through jan unless another person get more than pct of its voting power

small rise seen in
gasoline inventories analysts expect the american petroleum institute weekly report on oil inventories to show slight build in stocks of gasoline for the week ended may oil traders and analysts said
while the consensus is for an increase few would not rule out the possibility of an decline
traders said that barring any surprises in tonight report they expect the report to be neutral to bearish for oil prices
heating oil stocks are also likely to build and runs to be steady to slightly higher which could add pressure on oil prices the analysts said
crude oil was seen likely to build assuming imports continue at relatively high levels
analysts expect gasoline stocks to rise to two mln barrels above the mln reported for may
peter beutel oil analyst with elders futures inc who looks for build said we have had five weeks of gasoline demand at mln bpd or more and it is likely to taper off to between mln bpd which should make stocks build
demand would have to stay above mln bpd to have draw he added
rising demand is why oil traders and analysts expect draw in stocks of about of about one mln barrels
the energy information administration in its latest report for the four weeks ending may said that gasoline demand was up pct to mln bpd from the previous year
but analysts said hopes of reduced stocks is likely to founder on increased runs in refineries which could be up pct above may pct capacity operated
such an increase would raise runs about bpd and add to stocks
but some analysts said that refiners may have held refinery runs
heating oil stocks were also expected to build between barrels and one mln from the mln barrel level reported last week but rise in distillate stocks was discounted as having market impact at this time
build is seasonal now and not out of line with last year one futures analyst said
analysts said they also expect crude oil stocks to build between mln barrels and three mln from the mln barrels reported by api for the week of may
the consensus appears for about two mln barrels to be added to the nation inventory
shultz welcomes tokyo economic package secretary of state george shultz said the billion yen economic package announced by tokyo last week went further than the had expected
but he said the would not lift the selective economic sanctions it imposed on japanese imports in april until tokyo changed its sales policies concerning computer microchips
speaking in televised news conference linking several european capitals shultz said it was heartening that the japanese had confronted the problem of stimulating domestic and global demand
there is an even greater amount of stimulus than was originally thought said shultz speaking from washington
it is lot more than nothing
it is more than was talked about when prime minister yasuhiro nakasone was here
it involves major reduction in tax rates and we believe that getting the tax burden down is one way of stimulating the economy he added
but asked by japanese reporters also linked into the news conference whether the positive reaction meant the might decide at next week venice summit to lift its sanctions on some japanese electronic goods shultz replied these sanctions were undertaken on the basis of an agreement that had been reached between the united states and japan on various sale practices and prices relating to the chip market
they will be lifted as the facts of change by japan to the agreement that it made become evident
he said officials had only been able to monitor the situation for month and that it was impossible to determine trend on only one month data
imposed pct import duties on personal computers colour televisions and power tools alleging that japan had violated last september bilateral agreement by selling computer chips at below fair market value
shultz said west germany and other nations would also do well to look at what they could do to stimulate demand
asked whether the could reasonably ask its allies to take action to stimulate the world economy without bold american initiative to reduce the size of the federal budget deficit shultz said moves were already underway to tackle the problem
he said by the end of the current fiscal year the deficit would probably be reduced by around billion dlrs against last year and that the budget being worked on this year would contain major reduction

they said the ec failed to follow consultation procedures laid down in the lome convention which regulates relations between acp states and the bloc for moves which could affect trade between the two sides
they also said the ec would be in breach of an undertaking not to bring in new protectionist measures during the current punta del este round of world trade negotiations being held under gatt general agreement on tariffs and trade auspices
the ec commission has proposed tax of up to european currency units ecus tonne on both imported and ec produced vegetable and marine fats for human consumption which could raise up to two billion ecus year
ec farm ministers who would have to approve such tax are split on the issue and are expected to decide it at marathon meeting on ec farm prices beginning in luxembourg on june
jamaican ambassador leslie wilson said acp countries are convinced this would lead to ec industry substituting products made within the bloc for oil and fat imports
the acp estimates this would result in fall of to mln ecus in its member country exports
we can believe the ec would willingly take measures to undermine our countries but such would be the impact of these measures wilson said
the and malaysia say their exports would also be hit by the proposed tax and they may take retaliatory action if it is approved
wilson said the acp would take such steps only as very last resort but added that the acp is in touch with other countries which oppose the plan
wilson who was chairing the news conference made it clear jamaica itself would not be hit by the tax as it does not export oils and fats
among the worst hit countries would be ivory coast senegal nigeria and papua new guinea the acp says

soycomplex could rally on tight feed supply nearby months in soybean and soymeal futures could post short term rally on tightening supply of livestock feed even if favorable growing conditions keep the new crop outlook bearish traders said
lot of soymeal dealers are just getting very worried about where processors will get their soybeans this summer one illinois soyproduct dealer said
processors are competing vigorously with river dealers for the few soybeans being offered by country elevators with decatur illinois processor raising its spot soybean basis bid another two cents today to over july futures
farmer marketings of old crop soybeans continue very light with flat prices apparently well below levels they are willing to sell dealers said
some terminal elevator operators are coming to the belief that even if futures rally back to last month highs country movement may remain light because farmers in many areas are sold out of old crop soybeans particularly in the eastern half of the midwest
soybean processors will continue to take seasonal downtime for maintenance if soybeans remain difficult to buy reducing the weekly soybean crush rate still further and keeping the spot soymeal basis strong dealers said
futures traders said tight cash supplies should help july soybeans and soymeal gain on deferreds
july soymeal has already moved to premium over the august through october months and old crop july new crop november soybeans may also move to july premium later this month they added

kaufman says greenspan nomination bad for bonds henry kaufman managing director of salomon brothers inc said the nomination of economist alan greenspan to replace federal reserve board chairman paul volcker is bearish in the near term for the fixed income and currency markets
the basic direction of interest rates is not changed
the fundamental direction of interest rates continues to be upward interrupted by intermittent rallies kaufman said in statement
he said the implication for equity markets in neutral to bullish
kaufman said unlike paul volcker who entered the office of the federal reserve chairman with strong credibility both domestically and internationally mr greenspan will have to demonstrate both his competence and policy independence before he can gain full confidence of the financial markets
greenspan is most knowledgeable on the behavior of the economy while his professional skills in the international area are much more limited kaufman noted
consequently although he is well known abroad his views on issues such as the less developed country debt may initially carry less weight than have those of mr volcker

investment crucial to
textile recovery with more private investment not more protection the textile industry could become competitive with the most modern foreign producers analysts from two congressional agencies said today
the office of technology assessment nonpartisan arm of congress told house ways and means trade subcommittee hearing there was still concern for the future of parts of the textile and apparel industry but there was more reason for optimism than few years ago
while textile producers are making significant investments they could do more ota analyst henry kelly said
the congressional budget office cbo the nonpartisan budget analysis arm of congress said federal loans or loan guarantees would be preferable options for congress rather than increased trade protection which could lead to foreign retaliation
cbo analyst edward gramlich said past trade protections first imposed in the have had only small benefit for profits and investments of domestic firms
trade subcommittee chairman rep sam gibbons said the agencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion against congressional approval of protectionist textile quota legislation aimed mainly at western europe japan and other asian textile producing countries
president reagan last year vetoed textile protection bill but it was reintroduced in this session of congress and is expected to be voted on in the house this year
however approval this year is in doubt because passage of major trade bill without specific protections for textiles showed weakening of support for the legislation
most producers have fallen behind other foreign producers in the use of modern textile and apparel production equipment and net imports are growing faster than the domestic markets kelly said
he added that private investment in the textile and clothing industry in of pct was less than one seventh the average manufacturing investment of pct
despite existing import quotas and tariffs imports of textiles grew pct in and imports of apparel grew pct while production rose only pct
the traditional industry seems destined to be replaced by new technology imports or some combination of both
while the industry may not be able to compete in all domestic markets that it enjoyed twenty years ago the results of our research indicate that portions of the domestic market can be recovered and that exports can be expanded kelly said

near term strength seen for currency futures currency futures are likely to move higher following the sharp rally today after president reagan announced that paul volcker would not accept third term as federal reserve chairman and that alan greenspan was nominated as his replacement currency analysts said
contrary to predictions before the volcker resignation analysts are calling for higher currency futures prices between now and the june venice economic summit

the on the other hand has not cut its budget deficit as japan and west germany have urged she said
should members force commitment to cut its budget deficit in the next two years further decline in the dollar could be forestalled horner said
however the impact from venice will be nothing if nothing changes horner said

shultz predicts rapid narrowing of trade gap secretary of state george shultz said the would erase its large foreign trade deficit faster than many predicted and the consequences for its trade partners might be traumatic
the economy will inevitably make the adjustment necessary to move from deficit to surplus trade balance in order to service our growing foreign debt he told conference attended by the six members of the association of southeast asian nations and their leading western friends

fiji makes sugar payment to get harvest started fiji sugar farmers will receive an interim payment on the crop four months ahead of schedule in move aimed at getting harvesting of the drought hit crop under way governor general ratu sir penaia ganilau said
industry sources said latest forecasts for the crop indicated output of tonnes well down on the record tonne tel quel production in the may december crop year
the previous record was set in when fiji produced tonnes
for the past month fiji sugar farmers have delayed harvesting the crop pending response from the governor general to demands following the may coup
ganilau said in statement the fiji sugar corp would make payment of five dlrs per tonne against the final payment for the crop on the understanding that preparations by growers for commencement of harvesting would be completed at all mills by june
crushing would commence at labasa and penang mills on june and at lautoka and rarawai mills on june he said
the interim payment to be made on or about june is the full amount of the grower share of sugar proceeds received to date
the balance will be paid in october
growers had also called for the full forecast price of dlrs per tonne of cane to be paid in cash on delivery to the mill but this has been rejected by the state controlled fiji sugar corp ganilau said
however in addition to the scheduled delivery payment of dlrs an additional sum of dlrs or pct of the forecast price would be paid on december on all cane harvested by november he said
ganilau said this will be at least one month in advance of the expected date of payment of the second payment of cane
the balance of the second payment will be made six weeks after the end of crushing
another demand of fiji small farmers was that an estimated mln dlr loan from the fiji development bank fdb for the cane crop rehabilitation programme be written off
the fdb rejected this request
ganilau said however the bank is prepared to carefully consider requests for rescheduling loan repayments in cases of hardship on case by case basis
in response to further demand that all soldiers be removed from the cane growing areas ganilau said the army would restrict its presence in the cane areas
he said he had directed the authorities to issue permits to harvesting gangs cane growers and sugar industry trade unions to hold the necessary meetings in preparation for the commencement of harvest
senior representatives of the sugar cane growers had indicated desire to commence the crush as soon as possible he added

rpt european trade may propose new ico formula european coffee traders and roasters may propose new formula for calculating international coffee organization ico coffee quotas at the end of their meeting here this week traders and officials told reuters
although traders were unwilling to reveal details of the possible new formula they said it would give brazil the world biggest coffee producer unchanged ico quotas for the next two years and could be basis for renegotiation
the main sticking point on quotas has been brazil attitude and this compromise could be solution one said
however the european coffee trade federation meeting which began here today and is to continue to the end of the week has revealed gaps in the european position on re introducing quotas
traders said that as whole the trade side was against re introduction of ico quotas while roasters were generally in favour with the single proviso that there had to be some formula basis for re allocating quota shares among producing countries
the roasters said the positions were generally fairly close and problems with some government officials
germany and italy were cited as the extremes of polarized government attitudes with most other countries on the fence
sources said germany was the most extreme against quota re introduction while the italians were most in favour
nevertheless we expect to find enough common ground by the end of the week to at least present common european community ec view at the next meeting of consumer members of the international coffee agreement ica in july one trader said
we hope we can present the compromise proposal and that not only the consumer side but the producer side will accept it one official said
we have learned that we can live without the quotas that were suspended in february last year but would prefer the stability they can bring to the market as long as we do not simply return to the old and outdated status quo as far as quota allocation is concerned he added
overall however trader and roaster opinion on the likelihood of successful re negotiation was mildly pessimistic varying between chance and against
our main difficulty will be to persuade the on the consumer side and brazil on the producer side to agree to quota re introduction he said
position has if anything hardened while the new brazilian coffee institute president has adopted the least negotiable position of any of his predecessors one trader said
however with many producers starting to swing in favour of the consumer position that quotas have to be re allocated under new formula brazil is becoming increasingly isolated which gives at least some hope of compromise at the ico quota meeting in september the official said

indonesia rejects world bank farm reform proposals indonesia rejected world bank recommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy as the country foreign aid donors met to consider giving it billion dlrs in grants and soft loans
agriculture minister achmad affandi in written remarks distributed today as indonesia foreign donor nations met at the hague said the general argument presented by the bank for this free trade open economy view is weak
the bank called for overhauls in how indonesia manages the largest farm area in south east asia and said agricultural growth was stagnating under subsisides for rice farming
the bank report said indonesia rice production had peaked and the subsidies are waste of money
affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides an income for pct of the workforce
the subsidies were needed to support the fertilizer industry including importers exporters producers and distributors he said as well as assisting in small part the majority of indonesian farmers
affandi agreed with bank recommendation that farmers should be free to choose their own crops but he said the government would continue to maintain production targets for strategic commodities such as rice and sugar
the bank report was especially critical of indonesia drive to plant sugar saying domestic sugar prices are double the world average because of inefficiencies and the country would save money by importing the commodity
however affandi said volatile world sugar prices the need to save foreign exchange and an already up and running sugar industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive
he also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the agricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry develop and because of over production and price intervention in the developed nations

budget pact cuts farm funds billion dlrs house and senate budget negotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reached yesterday to cut billion dlrs from fiscal spending on agricultural programs congressional sources told reuters
the agreed cut in farm programs is compromise between billion sought by the senate and one billion by the house
the negotiators also agreed to cut billion from the farm budget in fiscal and billion in for total of billion in saving over three years sources said
the agreement presents the house and senate agriculture committees with difficult choices on how to make changes in agriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targets without jeopardizing popular support payments senior congressional aides told reuters
some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to find the budget savings
rep dan glickman kan chairman of the house grains subcommittee has introduced bill which would freeze wheat and corn loan rates for the crop at the current dlrs and dlrs respectively saying it would save mln dlrs
house agriculture committee chairman kika de la garza has said the committee will consider the glickman proposal
but congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to be approved because of opposition from republican lawmakers and strong stance by agriculture secretary richard lyng who said freezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major grain export competitors and would not achieve the budget savings glickman claims
another area where glickman and other have said budget savings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program arp levels for wheat and corn
however on this issue also lyng has taken strong stand within the reagan administration arguing that the crop wheat acreage reduction should be left at pct and not pct as sought by the office of management and budget omb
most commodity lobbyists expect lyng to prevail
congressional sources said the only way to achieve significant budget cuts through arp increases would be to boost the corn arp
but one informed congressional source said singling out corn for an arp increase would would be seen as unfair to one commodity
congressional sources said the areas where congress is most likely to eventually look for budget savings are some tightening of the payment limitation rules and possible adoption of program for the crops of major grains
those changes would achieve portion of the billion but not enough they said
ultimately congressional sources said the agriculture committees may be forced to apply an across the board cut on all commodity credit corp payments to farmers including price support loans and deficiency payments similar to the gramm rudman hollings budget cut applied in fiscal
this idea has been suggested by the american farm bureau federation afbf as the fairest approach for all commodities

opec differentials not seen posing major problems some opec states are unhappy about the prices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose great problems when the group reviews its six month old price and output pact in vienna next week oil analysts say
they said nigeria which holds the opec conference presidency and qatar probably have the biggest grievances about price differentials making some of their crudes uncompetitive
there has also been speculation by japanese traders that opec might want to mark up prices of high sulphur heavy crudes to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices
but most experts agree that major overhaul of price differentials is unlikely so as to avoid giving the market signals of dent in opec new unity
all opec members can make good case for changing differentials said one analyst with major oil company
but at the end of the day the attitude is going to be leave well alone and little or nothing is likely to be altered
iran libya and saudi arabia are among those who also saw sales problems earlier this year traders say
but diminished customer resistance to fixed prices and in some cases marketing incentives have helped their sales
some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by means of discounts processing deals or selling them alongside better priced grades in package
many opec crudes are seen to be reasonably priced at least for some part of the year
but many experts say opec should change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for fuel oil rich heavy crudes and gasoline rich lighter grades
at its last meeting in december opec agreed to reintroduce fixed prices from february around an dlr per barrel reference point
official prices had been effectively dropped in when members offered discounts to attract customers
opec also decided to limit first half output to mln bpd and proposed ceilings of mln for the third quarter and mln for the fourth
analysts expect it will now extend or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months
spot market and netback values for some crudes do not mirror official prices but opec will probably keep the dlr target and at most make minimal changes to differentials analysts say
the dlr figure is based on basket of six opec and one non opec crudes
opec assigned prices to its other key export crudes with dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest
extra heavy crudes were among those left out
industry estimates vary on the proportion of opec oil exports actually sold at official prices
several experts say only one quarter to one third of the total in fact sells at official prices with some of the rest included in processing or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products
problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year when some producers output fell due to customer reluctance to pay the new prices
nigeria especially found its gasoline rich bonny light crude now opec highest priced grade at dlrs barrel was uncompetitive on the spot market against britain brent
in february and march nigeria production shrank below its mln bpd opec quota
spot prices have since revived due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline and its output has risen
some experts feel bonny light is still overvalued and say its price should be cut by between cts to one dlr barrel
but mehdi varzi chief oil analyst with london kleinwort grieveson securities doubts nigeria will actively push the differentials question in vienna
it would not look good for opec unity if nigeria which holds the presidency raised the issue he said
new zealand budget forecast seen as positive analysts said they were surprised at the government announcement of forecast budget surplus for fiscal but said it was consistent with previous policy statements and positive for the economy
finance minister roger douglas predicted budget surplus for the year ending march of mln new zealand dlrs against billion deficit last year
analysts polled by reuters said the forecast budget surplus was even more positive than the most bullish analysts forecasts and that this was good news for financial markets
market expectations among analysts questioned by reuters before the budget varied widely between balanced budget and billion dlr deficit
but none predicted surplus
the forecast initially looks positive for both the bond and the foreign exchange markets one analyst said
paradoxically the new zealand dollar could rise in the medium term despite lower interest rates as overseas investors became more confident about investing in new zealand he said
however some foreign exchange dealers disagreed saying the local dollar is primarily interest rate driven and will move lower
the local dollar dropped to dlrs in after hours trading against just before the budget release
analysts said the budget was also positive for the share market despite an increase in the contribution of company taxation to revenue figures
one equities analyst predicted that the budget surplus announcement could push the share market up by points tomorrow
the budget statement was broadly as expected with continuation of existing policies and the absence of traditional pre election incentives would be viewed positively by overseas investors another said
but one merchant bank economist said that certain anti tax avoidance measures could damage some sectors of the share market particularly multi national companies
the government is also lowering its borrowing requirements through bond tenders as result of the surplus
the requirement for the rest of the year is now down to mln
dlrs from predicted billion
predicted revenue in the budget looked sustainable and there appeared to be no holding back on expenditure another economist said
he added that the document seemed entirely credible
altogether it looks good for labour election prospects he said
an election is due before the end of september

data depress rate cut outlook analysts today economic data have pushed the chances of another base lending rate cut from the current nine pct further into the distance analysts said
record fall in unemployment and good manufacturing production data showed that the economy is still strong and does not need fillip from lower rates
news that underlying earnings are rising pct annually taken together with higher than expected bank lending and money supply growth revived inflation worries and monetarist arguments against easier credit they said
the timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed back all the while
the strength of the economy and broad money growth are making it more difficult to see one in the near term said chase manhattan securities economist robin marshall
analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday mortgage rate cuts for new borrowers which building societies said were sign of the expected near term trend for rates
it also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week that post general election cut was imminent supported by such optimistic economic news as may record reserves rise which mirrored the bank of england efforts to cap sterling strength
the gilt market lost nearly half point as enthusiasm about may fall in the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate to mln or pct of the workforce was rapidly replaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlying average earnings in april dealers said
the upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lending rose billion stg in may above forecast and that the bank of england looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offset the impact on domestic money supply of its current intervention
the gilt market reaction was correct said bill martin chief
economist at brokers phillips and drew
that very important
it shows the economy in very good state indeed skeoch said
there no reason to get worries about inflationary pressures because they re very subdued
unit wage cost rises were better than expected just one pct higher in the year to april and it was these costs rather than average earnings which were potentially inflationary he added
don think these average earnings numbers are major problem agreed chase manhattan marshall
but he said the gilts market was likely to remain worried about the funding implications of recent intervention
he said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assets earlier this year attracted by growth prospects and hopes that the ruling conservatives would win last week election now looks likely to prevent base rate cut as the authorities try to prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system
however david owen
economist at kleinwort grieveson securities said any fresh sterling strength would still trigger base rate cut and that today figures did not signal higher inflation this year
wage increases are being offset by productivity growth
as long as that continues we re okay he added

arco lt arc spin off seen at mln dlrs atlantic richfield co considering spin off of pct interest in its chemical operations could gain about mln dlrs from the deal industry analysts estimated
yesterday arco stock jumped as much as five points on rumors it was spinning off the chemical operations
based on about mln outstanding shares the market in its frenzy was valuing the spin off at about mln dlrs analysts said
atlantic richfield aware of the rumors issued statement around mid day that it was considering sale of only pct of the unit leading investors to take profits
after the announcement the company stock retreated closing at up
today it was off
it was smaller deal than expected and somewhat disappointing said analyst george baker at smith barney
he said rumors of the spin off had been around for couple of days
baker said the unit was very profitable but it wasn getting the type of exposure atlantic richfield sought and its value was not reflected in the company stock price
industry analyst richard pzena of sanford bernstein said the unit had operating earnings of mln dlrs last year and he expected it to earn about mln dlrs this year
based on multiple of times earnings which pzena says chemical companies now sell for the entire unit is worth about three billion dlrs putting the pct interest at around to mln dlrs
pzena said he thought the company was selling the stake because chemical margins had peaked and he speculated the company would use the proceeds to pay down debt
but he added the possibility remained the deal would fall through
yesterday arco said the proposal had not yet been presented to its board
the chemical unit last year had revenues of billion dlrs

dutch consumers industry see veg oils tax threat dutch consumers and food processors would be hit hard by the proposed ec tax on oils and fats dick de bruyn chairman of the commodity board for margarine fats and oils mvo said at the annual meeting
the dutch are the second largest consumers of margarine and fourth largest consumers of vegetable oils in the ec
the fiercely contested tax would be levy on consumers and steeply increase the costs of industries such as potato processing and cake and biscuit manufacturing de bruyn said
move by these industries to countries outside the ec cannot be ruled out he added
de bruyn said the tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats would be wide open to fraud difficult to police and hugely expensive administratively
he also said the proposed tax contravened not only article three of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt the lome convention and the united nations food and agriculture organization fao guidelines but also the ec own treaty
the proposed tax would not only be inflationary but also have consequences for employment and investment he added

ec commission defends oils and fats tax spokesman for the european community commission defended the controversial plan for levy on oils and fats saying that consumers would have to help alleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax
norbert tanghe head of division of the commission directorate general for agriculture told the antwerp oils and fats contact days the commission firmly believes that the sacrifices which would be undergone by community producers in the oils and fats sector would justify asking consumers to make an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem within that sector by paying levy
the proposed tax is necessary because the level of budgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds production has become unacceptable tanghe said
recent estimates put these costs at billion european currency units and by they would rise by another billion ecus he said
in the community standstill agreements with spain and portugal end and the ec would then feel the full impact of its enlargement
the commission has proposed several cost and production cutting measures which include the introduction of maximum guaranteed quantity system he added
under the commission system for stabilising consumer prices in the oils and fats sector reference price of ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced tanghe said
consumer prices could be raised or lowered by regulatory amount when market prices are below or above this level
he said the revenue generated by charging regulatory amount would be used to finance the common agricultural policy oils and fats regime
the commission believes that hostile reactions to the proposed tax have for the most part been based on incomplete or an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal he said
tanghe said the proposed system conforms with general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt rules
it would not be discriminatory because it would be applied to domestic and imported products and past experience showed it would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats
ec produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do under present aid arrangements he said
the competitiveness between different oils whether ec produced or imported would remain unchanged and quantities imported from third countries would not be affected by the tax tanghe said
the proposed system would not alter the ec nations requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall effect would stabilise community production levels without affecting demand he said
it is one of the proposal objectives to maintain current import levels he said
imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are imported primarily to satisfy the ec cakes and meals requirements which are not covered by the stabilising system
furthermore more than half the oil produced from imported beans is re exported to third countries tanghe added

court rules against rtz on oil field costs the high court dismissed an appeal by rio tinto zinc corp plc lt rtzl rtz oil and gas ltd unit and ruled that the financial provisions company makes for the future cost of abandoning an oil field are not tax deductible the press association reported
the company was appealing against decision of the tax commissioners that any such provision was capital expenditure not revenue expenditure and was not deductible
the court was told that since the company had made an annual provision of around stg for the eventual cost of abandoning rig
an rtz spokesman said the ruling was not worrying as the subsidiary had assumed that the provisions were not deductible from corporation tax payable
it would have been bonus if the company had won but all budgeting had been on the assumption that it would not he said
oil analysts said that rtz assumption of liability was shared by the industry as whole
the ruling appeared to mean that tax relief on the expensive process of abandoning rigs would apply when the expense occurred not when provisions for future expenses were built into the accounts one analyst added

european community criticises trade measures the european community ec accused the united states of violating political commitment to free trade through practices including tax on imported gasoline and customs user fee
ec ambassador tran van thinh made the formal charge to the surveillance body of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt gatt spokesman david woods told reporters
woods also said the ec was joined by the united states in criticising brazil for extending its list of products for which import licenses have been temporarily suspended so as to improve its balance of payments
the united states charged japan with violating gatt rules by restricting imports of agricultural products through an import licensing system
the united states asked for consultations with tokyo on the issue
tran charged that the trade measures contravened political commitment to halt and reverse trade barriers pledged by ministers in punta del este last september
when ministers established the four year uruguay round to negotiate freer trade in areas they set up the gatt surveillance body to monitor this commitment known in gatt jargon as standstill and rollback
tran criticised washington for the superfund tax on oil imports customs user fee and the removal of special machine tool known as category from its government procurement list for reasons of national security
warren lavorel trade official defended the policies saying they did not violate gatt trade rules
the surveillance body will send record of today talks to the trade negotiating committee which oversees the round to decide any further action on the charges
the oil tax and customs user fee have already been the subject of formal gatt dispute panels set up outside the uruguay round to rule on the legality of the practices
the ruling gatt council yesterday adopted dispute panel report and ruled that the superfund tax on oil imports breached trade rules
it called on washington to modify its legislation
mexico and canada along with the european community brought the dispute to the gatt last year

zambian copper industry hopes for steady output zambia copper mining industry is hoping to achieve and maintain production at over tonnes year in the next few years despite low world prices deteriorating ores and shortages of mine inputs industry officials said
but zambia decision to abandon last may tough international monetary fund imf economic recovery program has introduced an element of uncertainty into plans to restructure the ailing industry and boost profitability they said
copper production by the government controlled zambia consolidated copper mines zccm for the financial year ended march improved slightly to about tonnes from record low of tonnes
we are convinced that by the end of the financial year copper production could well be over tonnes due to greater availability of spares and equipment zccm official said
zccm officials said the production of cobalt another strategic income earner will also be tailored to meet demand
finished production in was tonnes tonnes higher than the previous year and the best production achieved to date
protracted low world metal prices have badly hit the copper industry in zambia the world fifth biggest producer
mining is monopolised by zccm and accounts for about pct of the country foreign exchange earnings
production has also been seriously affected in recent years by equipment breakdowns deteriorating ore and shortages of spare parts fuel and lubricants
the tonnes output last year compared with peak output of tonnes
five year production and investment plan launched in by zccm is being funded by the european community the african development bank and the world bank
the plan foresees the shutdown of some seven mining and metallurgical units on the grounds they are unprofitable
zccm the second largest employer after the government has said it intends to lay off of its workforce as part of the plan

legislators were failing to realise the true nature of the two way street in terms of ideas technology and equipment
british parliamentary report said that up to march british firms had been awarded just mln dlrs worth of contracts for the strategic defence initiative compared with the billion dlrs britain had hoped to secure

bank of america sees slow consumer spending trade led boom in the is unlikely this year or next because growth in net exports will merely offset dramatic slowdown in consumer spending and other sectors of the economy bank of america said in its latest economic report
although net exports will add pct to gnp this year after reducing it by pct in consumer spending will contribute pct less to gnp than it did last year
as result gnp this year is likely to expand modest pct the same rate as last year according to daniel van dyke the bank of america economist who wrote the report
growth in consumer spending in the united states will drop dramatically this year because the jump in inflation will cause falloff in the growth of disposable income van dyke said
growth in consumer spending is likely to slow to pct this year from pct in he predicted
the report was released before the commerce department reported today that personal income rose just pct in may after increasing pct in april and that personal consumption expenditures had risen just pct compared with pct increase the month before
the rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boost consumer prices by an average of pct this year up from pct in bank of america forecast
this rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income growth to only pct in from pct in
as result van dyke calculated that the purchasing power of an average family of four will increase by modest dlrs this year compared to surge of dlrs during
the slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housing starts to drop by pct this year and further six pct in to an annual rate of mln units
for the first time in several years recession in or is more than remote possibility van dyke said
currently growth is fragile and depends heavily on an improvement in trade
however with protectionist attitudes on the rise in this country this source of growth is at risk he added
brooklyn union lt bu seen hurt by pipeline closure brooklyn union gas co new york gas utility will see its gas costs up sharply as result of transco energy co lt decision to close its pipelines to transport spot gas sales energy industry analysts said
brooklyn union the fourth largest gas utility in the united states purchased pct of its supplies on the spot or non contract market in and the proportion of spot supplies was estimated much higher in the five months of analysts said
texas eastern pipelines lt tet the other competing pipeline to deliver spot gas from producing areas in the south closed its gate station for summer and brooklyn union has relied entirely on transco for spot supplies
in the month of may brooklyn union paid about two dlrs per mln british thermal unit for spot gas while contract gas costs four to five dlrs per mln btu industry sources said
transco announced yesterday it would no longer provide open access to transport spot natural gas to its customers for fear of accumulating more take or pay liabilities
take or pay contracts oblige pipelines to pay producers for gas even if delivery is not taken by its customers
brooklyn union will continue receiving small amount of supplies from minor fields under grandfather clause brooklyn union official said
foster corwith gas analyst with dean witter reynolds said most of the rising cost to booklyn union will be passed through to rate payers
while net effect on the company will not be known for several months because of the time lag in deferred earnings end users especially residential and commercial customers will end up paying more for gas he said
because the closure takes place in summer months when gas demand is at seasonal low the impact on cash flow would be small curt launer natural gas analyst with donaldson lufkin jenrette said
if the situation persists into winter heating season high cost gas could cut in the company profits he said
gas utilities along eastern seaboard relying on transco for spot gas such as north carolina natural gas co lt ncng piedmont natural gas co lt pny will face the same high cost factor as brooklyn union steve richards supply manager with end users supply system houston based natural gas brokering firm said
but these companies are not unwitting victims of the take or pay dispute between transco and producers he said
distributors have turned deaf ear to transco request for an inventory charge which reserves the pipeline facility for spot gas to be delivered to these companies he said
without spot supplies the high cost of system gas will threaten to drive away large customers capable of shifting to alternative fuels he said
in absence of any guidelines on inventory charges from the federal energy regulatory commission the matter is being negotiated between pipelines and customers richards said
now that transco has refused to transport cheap spot gas for them these distributors are likely to be more conciliatory on the inventory charge he said
cool heads will prevail dlj launer said but it may take while

gillette lt gs seen object of global bidding war ronald perelman head of revlon group inc lt rev may be trying to ignite bidding war for gillette co that could draw some big international players and in the process make lot of money for himself wall street analysts said
several hours before regularly scheduled board of directors meeting gillette disclosed that perelman requested consent of its board for an offer of at least dlrs per share
perelman needed the consent because he agreed in november not to buy stock for years without permission
think ronald perelman is less interested in gillette and more interested in putting gillette into play because he stands to make ton of money said andrew shore analyst at shearson lehman brothers inc in play is term used on wall street to describe what happens when company becomes an unwiling takeover target
shore noted that according to the agreement revlon gets paid if there is any acquisition of gillette through november of this year at price higher than dlrs per share
gillette rose three to today following gain of three yesterday
the agreement would be calculated on the basis of perelman previous holding of mln shares adjusted for split
for example deal between gillette and some other company at dlrs per share would make revlon richer by mln dlrs under the formula
neither perelman nor his spokesmen returned telephone calls seeking comment
revlon stands to make substantial amount of money if someone else takes over gillette said analyst deepak raj of merrill lynch and co not saying that is going to happen but gillette is an undervalued stock with breakup value of dlrs per share
shore of shearson lehman said there are couple of reasons why perelman may not be really interested in acquiring gillette
he said perelman in the process of taking revlon private after acquiring control of the cosmetics company two years ago probably wants to concentrate on improving revlon operations
he trying to overhaul and improve the image of the dearptment store business
another reason is that revlon has recently made two other acquisitions
under those circumstances shore would not be surprised if some company such as unilever plc lt un as or procter and gamble co lt pg decided to take look at gillette
shore mentioned half dozen other potential buyers for gillette including sir james goldsmith hanson trust plc lt han rjr nabisco inc lt rjr american brands inc lt amb and ralston purina co lt ral
perelman is trying to put the company in play said wall street arbitrageur
he gets to share in the upside if the company is sold
another arbitrageur said he expects gillette to resist perelman overture
can see the board consenting what has changed between november and now he said
another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on
perelman never does anything without fair amount of calculation he said
but he added the gillette board has to be careful
they just can say no or they ll be sued by shareholders
gillette board was still meeting at edt three and one half hours after the scheduled starting time
according to copy of perelman letter released by gillette he would be prepared to sign defnitive merger agreement without any financing condition
he said citibank

mandatory farm control bill sen tom harkin iowa defended his controversial mandatory supply control farm bill and said farmers should be allowed to vote in referendum whether they approve of the proposal
the harkin proposal would set loan rates of dlrs per bushel for wheat dlrs for corn and dlrs for soybeans all to be put in effect under strict controls on planted acreage reductions
present loan rates are dlrs for wheat for corn and effectively for soybeans
also under the plan the would seek world market sharing cartel with the european community and other exporting nations to share out export markets harkin said during the first of several senate agriculture subcommittee hearings examining farm programs
harkin made the following claims in testimony on his family farm act
the mandatory control bill would increase farm income and reduce government spending on agriculture
harkin said his policy of high price supports would not ruin agricultural exports as critics claim but would increase overall revenue from exports
this would be done by seeking agreement among major exporting countries including the european community on market sharing at agreed high prices
sen christopher bond mo countered during the hearing that such grain export cartel is not workable
harkin acknowledged that higher commodity price supports would be passed onto consumers but he said high food prices stem more from gouging by food processing companies than from high farm product prices
harkin cited what he termed excessive net returns on equity over five years of pct at kellogg pct monfort pct nabisco pct conagra pct
heinz pct ralston purina pct pillsbury and pct quaker oats
harkin said legitimate concern about his bill would be the impact of higher prices on livestock producers
he said as transition to the higher prices he would allow livestock producers to purchase commodity credit corp grain stocks for three years
thereafter livestock farmers would benefit from predictable and stable grain price he said
harkin said that under his policy approach farm participation would be no more mandatory than the current farm program
he said farmers now must participate in farm programs in order to receive credit for planting and to protect farm income

oecd sees german growth hit by low domestic demand west german economic growth will slow to pct this year from pct in due to weak domestic demand and tougher competition from abroad the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd said in its semi annual review of the world economy
this view is less favourable than the west german government forecast of growth rate of under two pct this year but is in line with forecasts by independent economic institutes of growth ranging from to two pct
the oecd said that the economy should pick up next year with the gross national product rising by two pct in real terms
the oecd said it assumed the german economy was passing through period of temporary weakness and there would be some recovery in business confidence in the near future
but it warned that the key to an improvement in the economy was higher domestic demand which is only forecast to rise by pct this year and pct in below pct
while noting that the government is bringing forward five billion mark tax reform to january the oecd said that the medium to longer term performance of the west german economy could be improved by reduction of subsidies which would allow relatively lower tax rates
since the oecd report was compiled the west german federal statistics office has released figures showing that the gnp actually fell pct in real terms in the first quarter of this year compared with the final three months of
diplomatic sources here said that west germany appeared likely to finish the year with the lowest growth rate of any of the group of seven leading industrial nations

the oecd said france economic situation has deteriorated somewhat during the early months of
activity has slowed primarily reflecting an inventory adjustment while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflation has reaccelerated the oecd said
unemployment is likely to reach pct of the workforce by the end of
the report said inflation should slow and domestic demand pick up in the second half of this year

the slowdown would bring the inflation rate to pct for the whole year sharply up from last year pct

italian economic outlook less bright oecd says italy economic outlook for and is likely to be less favourable than last year with slightly lower growth higher unemployment and an increased trade deficit the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd said
but the oecd in its half yearly report forecast slightly lower inflation rate over the next two years
last year italy ranked as one of the oecd fastest growing economies with gross domestic product gdp growth at pct
the oecd said italy gdp may grow by three pct in but will then fall back to pct in
the inflation rate will probably stabilise at around five pct during the projection period as result of turnaround in import prices particularly oil an acceleration in labour costs and the effects of domestic demand pressure the report said

domestic demand pressure coupled with the deterioration in italian competitiveness is likely to stimulate imports and adversely affect exports in and
this could result in sharp negative contribution to the currrent account
japan trade surplus will grow again in oecd japan trade surplus is likely to continue to grow in as sales of japanese goods abroad increase while domestic demand remains sluggish the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd said
in its latest half yearly review of the world economy the oecd said japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus last year when domestic demand grew by four pct in while export markets rose by only two pct
but it said this differential between the growth of domestic and foreign demand would reverse in and thus weakening the international adjustment process
it forecast slowing in domestic growth to little over two pct but with rise in exports of pct in and pct in
as result the current account surplus in will rise to billion dlrs from billion in although in it should fall back to billion dlrs
the oecd outlook did not take account of the billion yen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demand and increase imports to japan
however oecd officials said the measures will significantly strengthen domestic demand quite possibly exceeding one pct gnp when the full effects have worked through and thus will provide some stimulus to imports
the oecd outlook said continued large current account surpluses and the further build up of an already substantial net external asset position could well lead to upward pressure on the yen
it said that further appreciation could then lead manufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus weaken domestic growth
the oecd said japan gross national product was likely to gorw an annual two pct in and below pct growth
but it said japan would continue its good performance on inflation with zero figure expected in compared to pct rise in consumer prices last year
canada ties seen worse without trade pact canadian ties could worsen if the two nations are unable to reach free trade pact according to study published by two nonpartisan public policy research groups
the cato institute of washington and the fraser institute of vancouver said removing the remaining tariffs on cross border trade would benefit both countries
but cato chairman william niskanen added the two nations generally harmonious trade relations are probably not sustainable without new agreement
the united states and canada whose cross border trade totaled about billion dlrs last year have been holding talks since last june on pact to end the few trade barriers remaining between their two countries
the put deadline on the talks of october but both sides have said an agreement is likely despite tough bargaining remained
niskanen said if no pact is reached bilateral trade ties could deteriorate because of congressional pressure on president reagan to implement trade laws more aggressively and this could hit some canadian trade practices
he noted canada is seeking foreign investment in its auto industry which could put strains on the considerable bilateral free trade in and canadian autos and parts
niskanen also said the canadian government is vulnerable to resurgence of economic nationalism which could restrict exports to canada
free trade pact backed by president reagan and prime minister brian mulroney would open new markets for canada and enable its industries to achieve economies of scale which would also help it widen exports worldwide he said
it would also increase the gross national products of both countries
niskanen said the goal of pact should be to end all tariffs within years lower subsidies on exports set rules for trade in services and investments end curbs on government procurement and agree ways to resolve trade disputes

belgium gdp growth may slow down to pct this year and next year bringing rise in the number of jobless the oecd said in its semi annual survey
belgian inflation could stabilise at to pct while the current account surplus will probably remain large at about three pct of gdp
while the belgian government has made progress in trimming its borrowing requirement it will probably be insufficient to check the self sustaining nature of the deficit the oecd said
in the netherlands real gdp growth will also slip to pct this year and one pct in with dutch exports becoming less competitive and imports rising
employment is forecast to decelerate as well reflecting more sluggish growth in the private sector and budgetary cuts the report said
dutch consumer prices are set to fall by pct in and stay stable in partly as result of declining domestic gas prices

in spain buoyant domestic demand led by fixed investment had been the driving force behind rapid growth in gross domestic product

oecd urges action to cut budget deficit the united states should take urgent action to cut its crippling budget deficit including possible reductions in non defense spending higher taxes and curbs on growth of the defense budget the organization for economic cooperation and development said
the oecd in its semi annual review of the world economy said failure of the reagan administration and congress quickly to agree on measures to cut the deficit could seriously affect confidence both in the united states and elsewhere
it predicted that the federal deficit in fiscal running until september this year would substantially overshoot both the balanced budget act target of billion dlrs and official
estimates in february of billion
the oecd projection which is based on assumptions of slower growth higher interest rates and actual data for the first half of the financial year is for deficit of about billion dollars it said
while this would be billion lower than last year deficit much of the improvement would be due to corporate tax increases being introduced before income tax cuts take effect
the economic growth rate is expected to edge up to pct next year from pct this year and last
in contrast to the last two years more competitive exports boosted by the fall in the dollar should help gnp growth
unemployment should continue to fall slowly as the service sector continues to create jobs

we would like to see the aggregate for the oecd area comfortably exceeding three pct david henderson head of the oecd economics and statistics department said
the oecd said that the dollar fall had led to rising inflation expectations and higher interest rates in the combining with world trade imbalances and the huge third world debt problem to increase the risks of world economic downturn
at the same time many of the conditions for faster growth remain favorable it said citing low inflation in most major countries healthy corporate finances generally lower interest rates improvements in state budget positions and more flexible labor markets
but private sector confidence had been undermined by uncertainties over exchange rates it said and warned that for confidence to be restored it is important for governments swiftly to implement internationally agreed commitments
this was clear reference to last february louvre accord of the group of five nations plus canada analysts said
the oecd said that apparent disagreements among major countries on implementation of the louvre accord had helped to undermine business confidence and called on more active fiscal policies from the west germany and japan to slow demand in the and raise it in the other two countries
henderson said the billion yen package announced recently by the japanese government to encourage public works and cut taxes would make significant contribution to this process though it was too early to estimate its precise impact
he said the measures will help strengthen japan domestic demand significantly quite possibly exceeding one pct of gnp

squibb lt sqb said not interested in buying cetus robert fildes president and chief executive of cetus corp lt ctus told reuters that squibb corp is not interested in buying cetus
earlier the companies said squibb would buy from cetus five pct equity postion in cetus for about mln dlrs
this is not an attempt by squibb to become major majority holder in cetus fildes told reuters in an interview
squibb has not approached us with any indication that they want to acquire us and we wouldn be interested in that kind of arrangement said fildes
squibb could not be reached to comment on the late comments by fildes
squibb is cetus first pharmaceutical partner and the only one to own an equity position in cetus
eastman kodak co lt ek and grace lt wr both have joint ventures with cetus but neither owns an equity position in the company said fildes
cetus has venture with kodak to develp diagnostic products and with grace to develop agricultural products
earlier squibb and cetus announced in joint statement an agreement in principle to form joint venture to develop new biotechnology products in several fields
as part of the deal squibb will license several of cetus anticancer agents including interleukin in development
squibb will sell the drugs only in japan and other markets but not in north american and western europe
we wouldn have done this deal had it not been understood that cetus wants to build its own fully integrated business in north america and europe said fildes
he said squibb was the good partner because squibb has major joint venture in japan and has sales capabilities of its own in that market
fildes said cetus has shunned licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies because it wanted to build its own business
many large corporations have invested in small biotech firms
but squibb investment in cetus is the first it has made in biotechnology
fildes said that was attractive to cetus because it wanted partner that didn have relationship with large number of other biotechnology companies
fildes said his strategy was to have partners in non drug areas like diagnostics and agriculture but to keep the biggest developments in anticancer drugs to ourselves
fildes said the partnership with squibb would be used to broaden the company reach in such big money making areas as the cardiovascular anti infective and the anti inflammatory markets
squibb is also investming mln dlrs in cetus research over the next five years
squibb is putting up over mln dlrs in research and development to make it happen while the equity position part of the package is simply to demonstrate the seriousness of this partnership said fildes

fall in canadian budget deficit to slow finance minister michael wilson said tax reform will not affect his determination to reign in expenditures but his forecasts show slowing of the decline in the budget deficit in the late
responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible wilson said in speech prepared for the house of commons
wilson estimated the deficit will fall to billion dlrs in the year ending march the same level as he forecast in the february budget
and in the year ended this past march the deficit was expected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the billion dlr shortfall originally forecast wilson said
wilson said in the current fiscal year higher than anticipated spending particularly in farm income support programs will be offset by higher than anticipated revenues
but finance department documents show the pace of deficit reduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal and as result of lower oil and grain prices and the transition to the reformed taxation system
the deficit is expected to total billion dlrs in fiscal and billion dlrs in and then fall to billion dlrs in
wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the canadian economy forcasting gross domestic product would expand pct this year and pct in

fed data suggest no change in monetary policy new banking data suggest the federal reserve is guiding monetary policy along steady path and is not signalling any imminent change of course economists said
but they also said that if money supply growth remains weak as this week unexpected eight billion dlr decline suggests it may this could influence the fed to loosen its credit reins and move toward more accommodative monetary policy
reuter survey of money market economists produced forecast of mln dlr decline for the week ended june with estimates ranging from gain of one billion dlrs to decline of four billion
instead fell eight billion dlrs to billion dlrs at seasonally adjusted annual rate
coming on the heels of billion decrease in for the week ended june this means the nation money supply has fallen more than billion dlrs in the past two weeks economists said
has hit an air pocket of weakness said bill sullivan of dean witter reynolds inc
while may have lost its significance as an indicator of economic growth sullivan said fed officials might be concerned the latest drop in means another month of sluggish growth in the broader monetary aggregates and which are seen as better gauges of economic growth
latest monthly and data showed that as of may both measures were growing at rates below the bottom of the fed to pct target ranges
if money growth does not accelerate fed officials concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging could turn toward easier monetary policy economists said
does this mean that the fed abandons its current open market position
no sullivan said
but does this mean the end of tightening for the time being
economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings of mln dlrs for the latest two week bank statement period were lower than they had expected
most believed the fed had targetted two week borrowings average of around mln dlrs
but they said that if it had not been for large one day net miss in the fed reserve projections the higher borrowings target would probably have been reached
drop in may housing starts and continued weakness in auto sales show key sectors of the economy are lagging while recent modest pct gain in may producer prices has helped dispel inflation fears slifer said
if this continues we can entertain the notion of fed easing at some point he said
other economists said the fed would probably pay little attention to weak money supply growth
it has been number of years since has given good signs of what going on in the economy one said
don think shows that the economy is falling apart and the fed should ease
economists agreed stable dollar will continue to be prerequisite for any move by the fed toward easier monetary policy
they said the fed is reluctant to lower short term rates for fear this would spur expectations of weaker dollar and higher inflation which would push up long term yields and choke off econmomic growth
but sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late april
the fed has to determine if this represents fundamental change for the dollar
if it does then this gives them more room to ease he said

shultz warns asean of looming trade problem secretary of state george shultz warned members of the association of southeast asian nations asean they could no longer rely on increased exports to the for growth
given the importance of exports particularly export manufactures to all of your countries you are going to have to work hard to diversify your markets he said
while you may be able to maintain your current market share in the you clearly will not be able to look to the to take major increases in your exports he added
shultz told the foreign ministers of brunei indonesia malaysia the philippines singapore and thailand the would cut its huge foreign trade deficit more rapidly than many now believed
he said asean looming trade problems would not necessarily stem from protectionist legislation now being contemplated by congress but simply because of the adjustments the economy will have to make in order to service our large and growing external debt
shultz said the deficit had resulted not from falling exports but from higher imports that had fuelled world growth

keh fei lo vice president of first commercial bank said it appears the central bank move to curb the capital inflow is quite successful

thai smelter faces tin concentrate supply shortage thailand major tin exporter and producer lt thailand smelting and refining co thaisarco said it may be unable to meet all its overseas orders because of insufficient supplies of tin concentrates from thai mines
local mines cut combined daily tin concentrate sales to thaisarco royal dutch shell group lt rd as unit to less than tonnes earlier this month from previous to tonne average commercial manager yoot eamsa ard told reuters
he said the cuts resulted from government decision to let the temporary business and municipal tax reductions on exported tin lapse on june

reduced tin exports this year could cause the atpc to allocate lower quota next year yoot said
the supplies shortage should prove temporary however because the thai cabinet is expected to review mineral resources department proposal to reinstate the low taxes late this month yoot said
the department said thailand exported tonnes of tin during january may compared with tonnes year ago

central bank warns of excessive rate cuts bank of england governor robin leigh pemberton said lowering interest rates too fast could jeopardise recent economic achievements in the
in remarks prepared for delivery to businessmen in birmingham he said prospective returns on real investment are more favourable relative to those on financial assets than for good number of years
it would surely be foolish to put that favourable conjuncture at risk by lowering interest rates prematurely or excessively he said
we might enjoy short term boost to activity but at the risk of damaging return to the uncertainty and acrimony of high inflation he added
leigh pemberton said he recognised there are some who would argue that interest rates are still too high and deter investment in industry
but we should not forget that less than year ago we were intervening to support sterling and had some temporary difficulty in persuading the markets that one pct increase in base rates to pct was sufficient tightening of policy at the time he added
base rate is currently nine pct

lenders offer more fixed rate mortgages more
lenders are offering homebuyers fixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes the same monthly payment no matter what happens to other interest rates
and with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in years the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers trying to lock into cheap money
the decision to offer fixed rate loans industry officials said reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home mortgage business
while fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the they were the mainstay of the business in the up until only few years ago
but in the early interest rates soared
lenders mostly savings and loan associations were earning rates as low as three pct on year fixed rate mortgages they held in their portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as pct to induce them to retain their accounts
as result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were forced to merge
the survivors decided to offer mortgages whose rates would move in line with the cost of funds
we very much have the example of the
thrifts in mind said spokesman for abbey national building society explaining why his institution for the time being is only offering variable rate mortgages
the rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders concede they are being forced to undercut each other still more
sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier this week by the nation two largest building societies and by national westminster bank plc reflect growing competition for new business officials at all three institutions said
the fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even below those on the variable rate loans
of course they are less profitable than other variable rate mortgages said spokesman for midland bank plc which earlier this year said it earmarked mln dlrs for fixed rate new mortgage loans
but he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable loans because it was just another way to attract people to our mortgage product
trustee savings bank plc tsb was offering five year fixed rate mortgages at pct earlier this year
the mln stg that tsb set aside for the loans was exhausted within just few days according to spokeswoman
everybody loves an under pct mortgage she said noting that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of pct of its volume
in short the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest rates
if interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the lender is earning an above average return on assets
but if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won the benefit of cheap money
household mortgage co had planned to offer year fixed rate mortgage after the june elections on the assumption that conservative party victory would help money market rates fall further according to duncan young managing director
young explained that the company had planned to protect itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying complicated hedging instrument
but money market rates have risen contrary to expectations and the company has shelved its plans for the time being
he said money market rates were too high to arrange both the mortgages and hedge profitably
however he said that when the household mortgage co does make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them
this means bundling different mortgages together to resemble bond and selling them to an investor
for technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate mortgages
in the where fixed rate mortgages are popular again securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money over the past few years

that is its highest level since january
opec conference president rilwanu lukman who is nigeria oil minister said friday he expects the meeting in vienna to be brief and calm and that opec current price and production agreement may only need slight review
although most industry experts expect just reaffirmation of the december agreement oil prices continue to climb due to desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises
analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon after the opec meeting
at that point barring any increased tension in the gulf or changes in opec policies prices should begin easing
opec will probably not do anything it hasn already agreed to in december because oil prices are firm said john hill vice president at merrill lynch futures
opec agreed in december to maintain official oil prices at dlrs barrel and raise the group production ceiling to mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to mln barrels in the fourth quarter
this agreement helped send prices sharply higher rising from dlrs barrel in early december
several opec members who are price hawks including iran algeria and libya will seek higher official price and reduction in output
and if west texas intermediate crude continues to trade above dlrs barrel there is greater chance that opec will raise its official dlrs price said nauman barakat analyst at smith barney harris upham and co
but most analysts expect the more moderate producers such as saudi arabia to block any changes in policy
the meeting will be non event with no change in the official prices because opec and in particular the saudis are committed to stabilizing the market said rosario ilacqua analyst with rothschild
however some analysts said opec may need to hold meeting in september to re evaluate market conditions
overproduction by opec will become real problem in the fourth quarter when the quota is raised to mln barrels day and iraq pipeline through turkey brings another barrels to the market each day said john lichtblau president of petroleum industry ressearch foundation
most expect saudi arabia to oppose price increase at this meeting but many look for an increase by year end to dlrs to offset the decline in the dollar
oil prices are denominated throughout the world in dollars so as the currency declines producers receive less money for their oil
the only real production restraint in opec is saudi arabia said sanford margoshes analyst at shearson lehman brothers
in the second half of the year we expect the saudis not to produce at their mln barrel day quota and therefore act as vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for two dlrs barrel price increase at the december meeting he said
one uncertain factor is the course of the iran iraq war
the wild card is the increased tensions in the persian gulf said frank knuettel analyst with prudential bache securites
oil tankers taking oil from iraq and kuwait have been regular targets for iranian planes
the reagan administration is planning to put kuwait tankers under the protection of the flag with naval escorts
extra oil inventories are needed during time of crisis like this and just general nervousness over an incident that could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up knuettel said

unocal lt ucl scraps fluidized bed boiler project unocal corp said it told the treasury department that it will not include fluidized bed combustion technology method for the more efficient burning of solids at its parachute creek oil shale project in colorado due to high costs
under agreement with the now defunct
synthetic fuels corp unocal said it would study using the technology at the oil shale plant
in return the company would have been eligible for mln dlrs in loan gaurantees and price supports from the treasury department which took over the contract from the synthetic fuels corp unocal said
unocal said its studies showed the cost for the fluidized bed combustion facility would have exceeded mln dlrs compared with an original estimate of mln dlrs
the fluidized bed facility would have provided heat and electricity for the oil shale project unocal said
last year fall in oil prices and the loss of investment tax credit under the tax reform act made the project uneconomical even with government price supports and loan guarantees unocal said
the parachute creek oil shale plant produces about to barrels per day of crude shale oil unocal said

platinum demand estimated pct higher by demand for platinum could reach mln ounces by compared with an estimated offtake of mln in chris clark platinum marketing director for johnson matthey plc said
clark told meeting of the minerals research organisation in milton keynes he foresaw ounce increase in consumption for use in autocatalysts currently the largest single application for platinum
jewellery consumption is set to rise by ounces clark predicted in his speech the text of which was released in london today
clark said his forecast allowed for only modest further increase in investment buying and may well be cautious
he said south africa was the most likely source of additional supplies and will need to increase output by about ounces to meet increased demand
the capital investment required to produce the additional output would be around one billion dlrs and the political climate may make it difficult to raise the money he said
the soviet union whose exports have declined since the might increase sales to the west by about ounces clark said
the very probability of growth in demand set against the massive investment required for expansion and that expansion only being viable in south africa or russia leads me to conclude that the price of platinum will be substantially underpinned in the medium to long term clark said
